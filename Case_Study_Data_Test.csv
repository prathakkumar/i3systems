 Ophthalmology," Browlift, Blepharoplasty, & Rhytidectomy ","PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Eyebrow ptosis.,2.  Dermatochalasia of upper and lower eyelids with tear trough deformity of the lower eyelid.,3.  Cervical facial aging with submental lipodystrophy.,OPERATION:,1.  Hairline biplanar temporal browlift.,2.  Quadrilateral blepharoplasty with lateral canthopexy with arcus marginalis release and fat transposition over inferior orbital rim to lower eyelid.,3.  Cervical facial rhytidectomy with purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.,ASSISTANT:  ,None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal anesthesia.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was placed in a supine position and prepped with general endotracheal anesthesia.  Local infiltration anesthesia with 1% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine was infiltrated in upper and lower eyelids.,Markings were made and fusiform ellipse of skin was resected from the upper eyelid.  The lower limb of the fusiform ellipse was at the superior palpebral fold.  A 9 mm of upper eyelid skin was resected at the widest portion of the lips, which extended from medial canthal area to the lateral orbital rim.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically and the skin was removed.  Incision was made through the pretarsal orbicularis with small amount of fat being removed from the medial and middle fat pocket.  An incision was made over the superior orbital rim.  Subperiosteal dissection was performed over the forehead.  The dissection proceeded medially.  The corrugator and procerus muscles were carefully dissected from the supratrochlear nerves on both right and left side and cauterized.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery in this fashion.  A 4-cm incision was made, and the forehead at the hairline, subcutaneous dissection was performed and extended over the frontalis muscle for approximately 4 cm.  A subperiosteal dissection was performed after the fibers of the frontalis muscle were separated and subperiosteal dissection from the forehead lead the subperiosteal dissection from the upper eyelid.  The incision was made in the lower lid just beneath the lashline.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed over the pretarsal and preseptal muscle.  Dissection was then proceeded down to the inferior orbital rim.  The arcus marginalis was released and the lower eyelid fat was teased over the inferior orbital rim and sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat and periosteum, which was separated from the inferior orbital rim.  The orbital fat was sutured to the suborbicularis oculi fat with multiple preplaced sutures of 5-0 Vicryl on a P2 needle.  The upper eyelid incision was closed with a running subcuticular 6-0 Prolene suture bilaterally.  The forehead was then elevated, and the nonhairbearing forehead skin was resected 1.5 cm wide raising the tail of the eyebrow.  The head of the eyebrow was felt to be elevated by the antagonistic frontalis muscle now that the accessory muscles specifically the corrugator and procerus and depressor supercilii were released and divided.,A lateral canthopexy was performed with 5-0 Prolene suture on a C1 double-arm tapered needle being passed from the lateral commissure of the eyelid to the small stab incision being passed to the medial superior orbital rim and sutured to tighten the lower lid.  The distal lateral resection of excessive lower eyelid skin was reduced at risk of eyelid malposition.  The lower lid incision was closed after the redundancy of skin measuring approximately 3 mm was resected on both sides.  Closure was performed with interrupted 6-0 silk suture for the lower lid.  The eyebrow hairline brow lift was closed with interrupted 4-0 PDS suture, deep subcutaneous tissue, and dermis, and the skin closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.,Attention then was directed to the cervical facial rhytidectomy and purse-string SMAS elevation with submental lipectomy.  Incisions were made in preauricular area, postauricular area, mastoid and occipital area.  Subcutaneous dissection was performed to the nasolabial fold and cheek and extending across the neck in the midline.  Submental lipectomy was performed through the incision in the submental crease.  Fat was directly removed from the fascia.,Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A SMAS elevation was performed with a purse-string suture of 2-0 PDS suture from temporalis fascia in front of the ear extending beneath the mandible and then brought back up to be sutured to the temporalis fascia.  This was performed bilaterally and symmetrically.  Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  The cheek flap was brought back posteriorly and the cervical flap posteriorly and superiorly with redundant skin on the right massaged and closed.  The skin of the cheek and neck were resected which was redundant after the ***** posteriorly and superiorly in the neck and transversely in the cheek.,Closure was performed with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 PDS suture of deep subcutaneous tissue and dermis of the skin was closed with a running 5-0 Prolene suture.  Drains were placed prior to final closure.  A 7-mm flat Jackson-Pratt was then secured with 3-0 silk suture.  Dressing consisting of fluffs and Kerlix and a 4-inch Ace were applied to support mildly compressive dressing.  Scleral eye protectors were removed.  Maxitrol eye ointment was placed followed by Swiss therapy eye pads.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and she returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition with Foley catheter and Pneumatic compression stockings, TED hose, two Jackson-Pratt drains, and an IV."

 Orthopedic, ORIF & Closed Reduction ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.,PROCEDURES:  ,1.  Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.,2.  Closed reduction casting of the right forearm.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , On the left was 29 minutes.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,There were no intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  ,The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today.  The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow.  After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure.  Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve.  At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced.  This was explained to the father.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms.  All questions were answered.  The father agreed to the above plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful.  It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction.  The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  The Esmarch was then removed.  An incision was then made.  Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve.  The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint.  This was easily removed.  The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact.  The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place.  After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement.  The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl.  The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform.  The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine.  The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation.  The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding.  Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed.  The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: , The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days.  The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings.  All questions answered."
 Gastroenterology, Flex Sig - 3 ,"PROCEDURE: , Flexible sigmoidoscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Rectal bleeding.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Diverticulosis.,MEDICATIONS: , None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon for a distance of 90 cm, reaching the proximal descending colon.  At this point, stool occupied the lumen, preventing further passage.  The colon distal to this was well cleaned out and easily visualized.  The mucosa was normal throughout the regions examined.  Numerous diverticula were seen.  There was no blood or old blood or active bleeding.  A retroflexed view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids.  He tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Sigmoid and left colon diverticulosis.,2.  Otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy to the proximal descending colon.,3.  The bleeding was most likely from a diverticulum, given the self limited but moderately severe quantity that he described.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.,2.  If there is further bleeding, a full colonoscopy is recommended."
 Urology, Inguinal Herniorrhaphy - 1 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Inguinal hernia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Direct inguinal hernia.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated.  The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors.  Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle.  This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed.  Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery.,The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found.  The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels.  This was dissected back to the hernia opening.  The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large PerFix plug inserted into the ring.  The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures.,The PerFix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures.  By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed.,The Penrose drain was removed.  The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery.  The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring.  The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.,Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

 Hematology - Oncology, Metastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Metastatic ovarian cancer.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.,Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.,At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY,1.

All endometriosis had been identified laparoscopically from a previous surgery.  At the time of the surgery, all the tissue was quite thick and difficult to cut as well around the bladder flap and the uterus itself.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position, at which time general form of anesthesia was administered by the anesthesia department.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion for a low transverse incision.  Approximately two fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis, a first knife was used to make a low transverse incision.  This was extended down to the level of the fascia.  The fascia was nicked in the center and extended in a transverse fashion.  The edges of the fascia were grasped with Kocher.  Both blunt and sharp dissection both caudally and cephalic was then completed consistent with Pfannenstiel technique.  The abdominal rectus muscle was divided in the midline and extended in a vertical fashion.  Perineum was entered at the high point and extended in a vertical fashion as well.  An O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was put in place on either side.  A bladder blade was put in place as well.  Uterus was grasped with a double-tooth tenaculum and large and small colon were packed away cephalically and held in place with free wet lap packs and a superior blade.  The bladder flap was released with Metzenbaum scissors and then dissected away caudally.  EndoGIA were placed down both sides of the uterus in two bites on each side with the staples reinforced with a medium Endoclip.  Two Heaney were placed on either side of the uterus at the level of cardinal ligaments.  These were sharply incised and both pedicles were tied off with 1 Vicryl suture.  Two _____ were placed from either side of the uterus at the level just inferior to the cervix across the superior part of the vaginal vault.  A long sharp knife was used to transect the uterus at the level of Merz forceps and the uterus and cervix were removed intact.  From there, the corners of the vaginal cuff were reinforced with figure-of-eight stitches.  Betadine soaked sponge was placed in the vaginal vault and a continuous locking stitch of 0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the edges with a second layer used to reinforce the first.  Bladder flap was created with the use of 3-0 Vicryl and Gelfoam was placed underneath.  The EndoGIA was used to transect both the fallopian tube and ovaries at the infundibulopelvic ligament and each one was reinforced with medium clips.  The entire area was then re-peritonized and copious amounts of saline were used to irrigate the pelvic cavity.  Once this was completed, Gelfoam was placed into the cul-de-sac and the O'Connor-O'Sullivan retractor was removed as well as all the wet lap pack.  Edges of the peritoneum were grasped in 3 quadrants with hemostat and a continuous locking stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the peritoneum as well as abdominal rectus muscle.  The edges of the fascia were grasped at both corners and a continuous locking stitch of 1 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the fascia with overlapping in the center.  The subcutaneous tissue was irrigated.  Cautery was used to create adequate hemostasis and 3-0 Vicryl was used to re-approximate the tissue and the skin edges were re-approximated with sterile staples.  Sterile dressing was applied and Betadine soaked sponge was removed from the vaginal vault and the vaginal vault was wiped clean of any remaining blood.  The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.  Instrument count, needle count, and sponge counts were all correct."
 Hematology - Oncology, Anaplastic Astrocytoma - Letter ,"XYZ,RE:  ABC,MEDICAL RECORD#:  123,Dear Dr. XYZ:,I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.,Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.,After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.,From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.,Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.,While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.,I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.,Sincerely,"

The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5.  In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above.  His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar.  He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms.  This has been ongoing for greater than five years.  No other associated symptoms or modifying factors.  Severity is moderate.  PSA relatively stable over time.,IMPRESSION: , Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms.  After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased.  At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification.  There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed.  He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia.  He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious."

Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days.  She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities.  No airway issues.  It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller.  She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest.  The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1.  I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure.  I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine.  A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic.  Excellent fixation achieved.  It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae.,I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck.  The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected.  Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline.  All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened.,During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain.,Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout.  X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes.,The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on.,The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days.  Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery.  She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course.,The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family."

The patient complains of difficulties with glare in performing activities of daily living.,INFORMED CONSENT:,  The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient in the office prior to scheduling surgery.  All questions from the patient were answered after the surgical procedure was explained in detail.  The risks of the procedure as explained to the patient include, but are not limited to, pain, infection, bleeding, loss of vision, retinal detachment, need for further surgery, loss of lens nucleus, double vision, etc.  Alternative of the procedure is to do nothing or seek a second opinion.  Informed consent for this procedure was obtained from the patient.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was brought to the holding area.  Previously, an intravenous infusion was begun at a keep vein open rate.  After adequate sedation by the anesthesia department (under monitored anesthesia care conditions), a peribulbar and retrobulbar block was given around the operative eye.  A total of 10 mL mixture with a 70/30 mixture of 2% Xylocaine without epinephrine and 0.75% bupivacaine without epinephrine.  An adequate amount of anesthetic was infused around the eye without giving excessive tension to the eye or excessive chemosis to the periorbital area.  Manual pressure and a Honan balloon were placed over the eye for approximately 2 minutes after injection and adequate akinesia and anesthesia was noted.  Vital sign monitors were detached from the patient.  The patient was moved to the operative suite and the same monitors were reattached.  The periocular area was cleansed, dried, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for ocular surgery.  The speculum was set into place and the operative microscope was brought over the eye.  The eye was examined.  Adequate mydriasis was observed and a visually significant cataract was noted on the visual axis.,A temporal clear corneal incision was begun using a crescent blade with an initial groove incision made partial thickness through the temporal clear cornea.  Then a pocket incision was created without entering the anterior chamber of the eye.  Two peripheral paracentesis ports were created on each side of the initial incision site.  Viscoelastic was used to deepen the anterior chamber of the eye.  A 2.65 mm keratome was then used to complete the corneal valve incision.  A cystitome was bent and created using a tuberculin syringe needle.  It was placed in the anterior chamber of the eye.  A continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis was begun.  It was completed using O'Gawa Utrata forceps.  A balanced salt solution on the irrigating cannula was placed through the paracentesis port of the eye to affect hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the lens nucleus.  The lens nucleus was noted to be freely mobile in the bag.,The phacoemulsification tip was placed into the anterior chamber of the eye.  The lens nucleus was phacoemulsified and aspirated in a divide-and-conquer technique.  All remaining cortical elements were removed from the eye using irrigation and aspiration using a bimanual technique through the paracentesis ports.  The posterior capsule remained intact throughout the entire procedure.  Provisc was used to deepen the anterior chamber of the eye.  A crescent blade was used to expand the internal aspect of the wound.  The lens was taken from its container and inspected.  No defects were found.  The lens power selected was compared with the surgery worksheet from Dr. X's office.  The lens was placed in an inserter under Provisc.  It was placed through the wound, into the capsular bag and extruded gently from the inserter.  It was noted to be adequately centered in the capsular bag using a Sinskey hook.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with irrigation an aspiration through the paracentesis side ports using a bimanual technique.  The eye was noted to be inflated without overinflation.  The wounds were tested for leaks, none were found.  Five drops dilute Betadine solution was placed over the eye.  The eye was irrigated.  The speculum was removed.  The drapes were removed.  The periocular area was cleaned and dried.  Maxitrol ophthalmic ointment was placed into the interpalpebral space.  A semi-pressure patch and shield was placed over the eye.  The patient was taken to the floor in stable and satisfactory condition, was given detailed written instructions and asked to follow up with Dr. X tomorrow morning in the office."

 Orthopedic, ORIF - 3 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):, Left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture.,PROCEDURE:, Open reduction internal fixation of the left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture (27513).,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:, He had intercondylar split, and then he had a medial Hoffa fracture. He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segments of the medial condyle.,IMPLANTS:, We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, as well as a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate.,COMPLICATIONS:, None.,IV FLUIDS:, 2000,ANESTHESIA:, General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:, 40 mL,URINE OUTPUT:, 650,HISTORY: ,This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He was admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefits were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:, The patient was identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia was obtained, his left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He was given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give us better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there was an intercondylar split and then two free pieces of the medial condyle. The femur fracture was very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragments and cleaned the cortical margins.,Next we began the reduction. There was no reduction key between the two segments of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave us a nice notch contour. Again, there was some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segments did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screws from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screws from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screws ran between and out of the notch.,With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral views that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position.,With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screws to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screws in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw was proximal to the tip of the prosthesis.,At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm views which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate was in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liters of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to Recovery in stable condition.,PLAN:,1. Nonweightbearing for 3 months.,2. CPM for 0 to 90 degrees as tolerated."

A time-out process had been followed and then the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the endotracheal tube after 2 cc of 4% lidocaine had been infused into the endotracheal tube.  First the trachea and the carina had normal appearance.  The scope was passed into the left side and the bronchial system was found to be normal.  There were scars and mucoid secretions.  Then the scope was passed into the right side where brown secretions were obtained and collected in a trap to be sent for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic fungi and TB.  First, the basal lobes were explored and found to be normal.  Then, the right upper lobe was selectively cannulated and no abnormalities were found except some secretions were aspirated.  Then, the bronchi going to the three segments were visualized and no abnormalities or mass were found.  Brush biopsy was obtained from one of the segments and sent to Pathology.,The procedure had to be interrupted several times because of the patient's desaturation, but after a few minutes of Ambu bagging, he recovered satisfactorily.,At the end, the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.,"

 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Pulmonary Atresia ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 9-year-old born with pulmonary atresia, intact ventricular septum with coronary sinusoids.  He also has VACTERL association with hydrocephalus.  As an infant, he underwent placement of a right modified central shunt.  On 05/26/1999, he underwent placement of a bidirectional Glenn shunt, pulmonary artery angioplasty, takedown of the central shunt, PDA ligation, and placement of a 4 mm left-sided central shunt.  On 08/01/2006, he underwent cardiac catheterization and coil embolization of the central shunt.  A repeat catheterization on 09/25/2001 demonstrated elevated Glenn pressures and significant collateral vessels for which he underwent embolization.  He then underwent repeat catheterization on 11/20/2003 and further embolization of residual collateral vessels.  Blood pressures were found to be 13 mmHg with the pulmonary vascular resistance of 2.6-3.1 Wood units.  On 03/22/2004, he returned to the operating room and underwent successful 20 mm extracardiac Fontan with placement of an 8-mm fenestration and main pulmonary artery ligation.  A repeat catheterization on 09/07/2006, demonstrated mildly elevated Fontan pressures in the context of a widely patent Fontan fenestration and intolerance of Fontan fenestration occlusion.  The patient then followed conservatively since that time.  The patient is undergoing a repeat evaluation to assess his candidacy for a Fontan fenestration occlusion, as well as consideration for a tricuspid valvuloplasty in attempt to relieve right ventricular hypertension and associated membranous ventricular aneurysm protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract.,PROCEDURE:,  After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped.  Cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets.  Vascular entry was by percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized.  Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures, in addition to intravascular pressures.,Using a 7-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava along the Fontan conduit into the main left pulmonary artery, as well as the superior vena cava.  This catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French VS catheter of a distal wire.  Apposition of the right pulmonary artery over, which the wedge catheter was advanced.  The wedge catheter could then be easily advanced across the Fontan fenestration into the right atrium and guidewire manipulation allowed access across the atrial septal defect to the pulmonary veins, left atrium, and left ventricle.,Using a 5-French sheath, a 5-French pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta, ascending aorta, and left ventricle.  Attempt was then made to cross the tricuspid valve from the right atrium and guidewire persisted to prolapse through the membranous ventricular septum into the left ventricle.  The catheter distal wire position was finally achieved across what appeared to be the posterior aspect of the tricuspid valve, both angiographically as well as equal guidance.  Left ventricular pressure was found to be suprasystemic.  A balloon valvoplasty was performed using a Ranger 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with no waste at minimal inflation pressure.  Echocardiogram, which showed no significant change in the appearance of a tricuspid valve and persistence of aneurysmal membranous ventricular septum.  Further angioplasty was then performed first utilizing a 6 mm cutting balloon directed through 7-French flexor sheath positioned within the right atrium.  There was a disappearance of a mild waist prior to spontaneous tear of the balloon.  The balloon catheter was then removed in its entirety.,Echocardiogram again demonstrated no change in the appearance of the tricuspid valve.  A final angioplasty was performed utilizing a 80 mm cutting balloon with the disappearance of a distinctive waste.  Echocardiogram; however, demonstrated no change and intact appearing tricuspid valve and no decompression of the right ventricle.  Further attempts to cross tricuspid valve were thus abandoned.  Attention was then directed to a Fontan fenestration.  A balloon occlusion then demonstrated minimal increase in Fontan pressures from 12 mmHg to 15 mmHg.  With less than 10% fall in calculated cardiac index.  The angiogram in the inferior vena cava demonstrated a large fenestration measuring 6.6 mm in diameter with a length of 8 mm.  A 7-French flexor sheath was again advanced cross the fenestration.  A 10-mm Amplatzer muscular ventricular septal defect occluder was loaded on delivery catheter and advanced through the sheath where the distal disk was allowed to be figured in the right atrium.  Entire system was then brought into the fenestration and withdrawal of the sheath allowed reconfiguration of the proximal disk.  Once the stable device configuration was confirmed, device was released from the delivery catheter.  Hemodynamic assessment and the angiograms were then repeated.,Flows were calculated by the Fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from Radiometer Hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity.,Angiograms with injection in the right coronary artery, left coronary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and right ventricle.,After angiography, two normal-appearing renal collecting systems were visualized.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no complications.,DISCUSSION: , Oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal.  Mixed venous saturation was low due to systemic arterial desaturation.  There was modest increased saturation of the branch pulmonary arteries due to the presumed aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The right pulmonary veins were fully saturated.  Left pulmonary veins were not entered.  There was a fall in saturation within the left ventricle and descending aorta due to a right to left shunt across the Fontan fenestration.  Mean Fontan pressures were 12 mmHg with a 1 mmHg fall in mean pressure into the distal left pulmonary artery.  Right and left pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were similar to left atrial phasic pressure with an A-wave similar to the normal left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 11 mmHg.  Left ventricular systolic pressure was normal with at most 5 mmHg systolic gradient pressure pull-back to the ascending aorta.  Phasic ascending and descending aortic pressures were similar and normal.  The calculated systemic flow was normal.  Pulmonary flow was reduced to the QT-QS ratio of 0.7621.  Pulmonary vascular resistance was normal at 1 Wood units.,Angiogram with injection in the right coronary artery demonstrated diminutive coronary with an extensive sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  The left coronary angiogram showed a left dominant system with a brisk flow to the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.  There was communication to the right-sided coronary sinusoidal communication to the rudimentary right ventricle.  Angiogram with injection in the superior vena cava showed patent right bidirectional Glenn shunt with mild narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery, as well as the central pulmonary artery, diameter of which was augmented by the Glenn anastomosis and the Fontan anastomosis.  There was symmetric contrast flow to both pulmonary arteries.  A large degree of contrast flowed retrograde into the Fontan and shunting into the right atrium across the fenestration.  There is competitive flow to the upper lobes presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow.  The branch pulmonaries appeared mildly hypoplastic.  Levo phase contrast returned into the heart, appeared unobstructed demonstrating good left ventricular contractility.  Angiogram with injection in the Fontan showed a widely patent anastomosis with the inferior vena cava.  Majority of the contrast flowing across the fenestration into the right atrium with a positive flow to the branch pulmonary arteries.,Following the device occlusion of Fontan fenestration, the Fontan and mean pressure increased to 15 mmHg with a 3 mmHg, a mean gradient in the distal left pulmonary artery and no gradient into the right pulmonary artery.  There was an increase in the systemic arterial pressures.  Mixed venous saturation increased from the resting state as with increase in systemic arterial saturation to 95%.  The calculated systemic flow increased slightly from the resting state and pulmonary flow was similar with a QT-QS ratio of 0.921.  Angiogram with injection in the inferior vena cava showed a stable device configuration with a good disk apposition to the anterior surface of the Fontan with no protrusion into the Fontan and no residual shunt and no obstruction to a Fontan flow.  An ascending aortogram that showed a left aortic arch with trace aortic insufficiency and multiple small residual aortopulmonary collateral vessels arising from the intercostal arteries.  A small degree of contrast returned to the heart.,INITIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,1.  Pulmonary atresia.,2.  VACTERL association.,3.  Persistent sinusoidal right ventricle to the coronary communications.,4.

 Gastroenterology, Barium Swallow Study & Speech Evaluation ,"CURRENT MEDICATIONS:,  Lortab.,PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: , Cardiac stent in 2000.,PATIENT'S GOAL: , To eat again by mouth.,STUDY:  ,A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management.  A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.,The patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis.  The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration.  A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.,For his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps.  Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes.  On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.,FINDINGS:  ,The patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve.  He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation.  Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve.  The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day.

He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery.  The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits.  The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment.  He was placed on the treatment table.  The Aquaplast mask was constructed.  Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system.  The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford.  Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered.  Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices.  These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home.,Treatment plan was then performed by me.  I outlined the tumor volume.  Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient.  This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator.  The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy.  The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm.  The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%.  The coverage isodose line was 79%.  The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55.

Repair of dural tear with Prolene 6-0 and Tisseel.,FLUIDS:,  1500 cc of crystalloid.,URINE OUTPUT: , 200 cc.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal anesthesia.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Less than 250 cc.,INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION:  ,This is the case of a very pleasant 41 year-old Caucasian male well known to me from previous anterior cervical discectomy and posterior decompression.  Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06.  The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius.  Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis.  It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation.  Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  The patient understood the risk of the surgery.  I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring.  The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  All pressure points were padded.  I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified.  There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel.  By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam.  After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel.  The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch.  The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery."
 Urology, Foreign Object Removal - Urethra ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Prostate cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Prostate cancer.,OPERATION: , Cystoscopy and removal of foreign objects from the urethra.,BRACHYTHERAPY:,  Iodine 125.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg IV preoperatively.,Total seeds were 59.  Activity of 0.439, 30 seeds in the periphery with 10 needles and total of 8 seeds at the anterior of the fold, 4 needles.  Please note that the total needles placed on the top were actually 38 seeds and 22 seeds were returned back.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 72-year-old male who presented to us with elevated PSA and prostate biopsy with Gleason 6 cancer on the right apex.  Options such as watchful waiting, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and external beam radiation were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, dysuria, burning pain, hematuria, future procedures, and failure of the procedure were all discussed.  The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient wanted to wait until he came back from his summer vacations, so a one dose of Zoladex was given.  Prostate size measured about 15 g in the OR and about 22 g about two months ago.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had a Foley catheter placed sterilely.  The scrotum was taped up using Ioban.  Transrectal ultrasound was done.  The prostate was measured 15 g.  Multiple images were taken.  A volume study was done.  This was given to the physicist, Dr. X was present who is radiation oncologist who helped with implanting of the seeds.  Total of 38 seeds were placed in the patient with 10 peripheral needles and then 4 internal needles.  Total of 30 seeds were placed in the periphery and total of 8 seeds were placed in the inside.  They were done directly under transrectal ultrasound vision.  The seeds were placed directly under ultrasound guidance.  There was a nice distribution of the seeds.  A couple of more seeds were placed on the right side due to the location of the prostate cancer.  Subsequently at the end of the procedure, fluoroscopy was done.  Couple of images were obtained.  Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure where a seed was visualized right in the urethra, which was grasped and pulled out using grasper, which was difficult to get the seed off of the spacers, which was actually pulled out.  There were no further seeds visualized in the bladder.  The bladder appeared normal.  At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was kept in place of 18 French and the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition."
 Obstetrics / Gynecology, Hysterectomy - Laparoscopic Supracervical ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 100 mL.,FINDINGS: , An 8-10 cm anteverted uterus, right ovary with a 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm simple cyst containing straw colored fluid, a normal-appearing left ovary, and normal-appearing tubes bilaterally.,SPECIMENS:  ,Uterine fragments.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR where general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained without difficulty.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  Examination under anesthesia revealed an anteverted uterus and no adnexal masses.  The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed in the patient's bladder.  The patient's cervix was visualized with speculum.  A single-tooth tenaculum was placed on the anterior lip of the cervix.  A HUMI uterine manipulator was placed through the internal os of the cervix and the balloon was inflated.  The tenaculum and speculum were then removed from the vagina.  Attention was then turned to the patient's abdomen where a small infraumbilical incision was made with scalpel.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the patient's abdomen was inflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  Veress needle was removed and then 5-mm trocar was placed through the umbilical incision.  Laparoscope was placed through this incision and the patient's abdominal contents were visualized.  A 2nd trocar incision was placed in the midline 2 cm above the symphysis pubis and a 5-mm trocar was placed through this incision on direct visualization for laparoscope.  A trocar incision was made in the right lower quadrant.  A 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  A ___ trocar incision was made in the left lower quadrant and a 2nd 10-mm trocar was placed through this incision under direct visualization with the laparoscope.  The patient's abdominal and pelvic anatomy were again visualized with the assistance of a blunt probe.  The Gyrus cautery was used to cauterize and cut the right and left round ligaments.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament was bluntly dissected and cauterized and cut in an inferior fashion towards lower uterine segment.  The right uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  The uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The Gyrus was then used to cauterize the right uterine vessels.  Gyrus was then used on the left side to cauterize and cut the left round ligament.  The anterior leaf of the broad ligament on the left side was bluntly dissected, cauterized, and cut.  Using the Gyrus, the left uteroovarian ligament was cauterized and cut and the left uterine vessels were then bluntly dissected.  The left uterine vessels were then cauterized and cut using the Gyrus.  At this point, as the uterine vessels had been cauterized on both sides, the uterine body exhibited blanching.  At this point, the Harmonic scalpel hook was used to amputate the uterine body from the cervix at the level just below the uterine vessels.  The HUMI manipulator was removed prior to amputation of the uterine body.  After the uterine body was detached from the cervical stump, morcellation of the uterine body was performed using the uterine morcellator.  The uterus was removed in a piecemeal fashion through the right lower quadrant trocar incision.  Once, all fragments of the uterus were removed from the abdominal cavity, the pelvis was irrigated.  The Harmonic scalpel was used to cauterize the remaining endocervical canal.  The cervical stump was also cauterized with the Harmonic scalpel and good hemostasis was noted at the cervical stump and also at the sites of all pedicles.  The Harmonic scalpel was then used to incise the right ovarian simple cyst.  The right ovarian cyst was then drained yielding straw-colored fluid.  The site of right ovarian cystotomy was noted to be hemostatic.  The pelvis was again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The ureters were identified on both sides and noted to be intact throughout the visualized course.  All instruments were then removed from the patient's abdomen and the abdomen was deflated.  The fascial defects at the 10-mm trocar sites were closed using figure-of-8 sutures of 0-Vicryl and skin incisions were closed with a 4-0 Vicryl in subcuticular fashion.  The cervix was then visualized with the speculum.  Good hemostasis at the site of tenaculum insertion was obtained using silver nitrate sticks.  All instruments were removed from the patient's vagina and the patient was placed in normal supine position.,Sponge, lap, needle, and instrument counts were correct x2.  The patient was awoken from anesthesia and then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."

The hypopharynx was normal.  The esophagus had a normal upper esophageal sphincter, normal contour throughout, and a normal gastroesophageal junction viewed at 39 cm from the incisors.  There was no evidence of stricturing or extrinsic narrowing from her previous hiatal hernia repair.  There was no sign of reflux esophagitis.  On entering the gastric lumen, a large bezoar of undigested food was seen occupying much of the gastric fundus and body.  It had 2 to 3 mm diameter.  This was broken up using a scope into smaller pieces.  There was no retained gastric liquid.  The antrum appeared normal and the pylorus was patent.  The scope passed easily into the duodenum, which was normal through the second portion.  On withdrawal of the scope, additional views of the cardia were obtained, and there was no evidence of any tumor or narrowing.  The scope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  Normal postoperative hernia repair.,2.

 Neurosurgery, Hemicraniectomy ,"TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Left-sided large hemicraniectomy for traumatic brain injury and increased intracranial pressure.,INDICATION FOR SURGERY: ,  The patient is a patient well known to my service.  She came in with severe traumatic brain injury and severe multiple fractures of the right side of the skull.  I took her to the operating a few days ago for a large right-sided hemicraniectomy to save her life.  I spoke with the family, the mom, especially about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure, most especially given the fact that she had undergone a very severe traumatic brain injury with a very poor GCS of 3 in some brainstem reflexes.  I discussed with them that this was a life-saving procedure and the family agreed to proceed with surgery as a level 1.  We went to the operating room at that time and we did a very large right-sided hemicraniectomy.  The patient was put in the intensive care unit.  We had placed also at that time a left-sided intracranial pressure monitor both which we took out a few days ago.  Over the last few days, the patient began to slowly deteriorate little bit on her clinical examination, that is, she was at first localizing briskly with the right side and that began to be less brisk.  We obtained a CT scan at this point, and we noted that she had a fair amount of swelling in the left hemisphere with about 1.5 cm of midline shift.  At this point, once again I discussed with the family the possibility of trying to save her life and go ahead and doing a left-sided very large hemicraniectomy with this __________  this was once again a life-saving procedure and we proceeded with the consent of mom to go ahead and do a level 1 hemicraniectomy of the left side.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  She was already intubated and under general anesthesia.  The head was put in a 3-pin Mayfield headholder with one pin in the forehead and two pins in the back to be able to put the patient with the right-hand side down and the left-hand side up since on the right-hand side, she did not have a bone flap which complicated matters a little bit, so we had to use a 3-pin Mayfield headholder.  The patient tolerated this well.  We sterilely prepped everything and we actually had already done a midline incision prior to this for the prior surgery, so we incorporated this incision into the new incision, and to be able to open the skin on the left side, we did a T-shaped incision with T vertical portion coming from anterior to the ear from the zygoma up towards the vertex of the skull towards the midline of the skin.  We connected this.  Prior to this, we brought in all surgical instrumentation under sterile and standard conditions.  We opened the skin as in opening a book and then we also did a myocutaneous flap.  We brought in the muscle with it.  We had a very good exposure of the skull.  We identified all the important landmarks including the zygoma inferiorly, the superior sagittal suture as well as posteriorly and anteriorly.  We had very good landmarks, so we went ahead and did one bur hole and the middle puncta right above the zygoma and then brought in the craniotome and did a very large bone flap that measured about 7 x 9 cm roughly, a very large decompression of the left side.  At this point, we opened the dura and the dura as soon as it was opened, there was a small subdural hematoma under a fair amount of pressure and cleaned this very nicely irrigated completely the brain and had a few contusions over the operculum as well as posteriorly.  All this was irrigated thoroughly.  Once we made sure we had absolutely great hemostasis without any complications, we went ahead and irrigated once again and we had controlled the meddle meningeal as well as the superior temporal artery very nicely.  We had absolutely good hemostasis.  We put a piece of Gelfoam over the brain.  We had opened the dura in a cruciate fashion, and the brain clearly bulging out despite of the fact that it was in the dependent position.  I went ahead and  irrigated everything thoroughly putting a piece of DuraGen as well as a piece of Gelfoam with very good hemostasis and proceeded to close the skin with running nylon in place.  This running nylon we put in place in order not to put any absorbables, although I put a few 0 popoffs just to approximate the skin nicely.  Once we had done this, irrigated thoroughly once again the skin.  We cleaned up everything and then we took the patient off __________ anesthesia and took the patient back to the intensive care unit.  The EBL was about 200 cubic centimeters.  Her hematocrit went down to about 21 and I ordered the patient to receive one unit of blood intraoperatively which they began to work on as we began to continue to do the work and the sponges and the needle counts were correct.  No complications.  The patient went back to the intensive care unit."
 Orthopedic, Bunion & Pes Planovalgus Deformity ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left.  The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well.  The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago.  She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot.  The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart.  Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds.  She has palpable pulses.  Neurologic sensation is intact.  Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy.  There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement.  She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right.  Gait analysis:  The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet.,X-RAY INTERPRETATION:,  X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy.  Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle.  No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted.  Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot.,2.  Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet.,PLAN/TREATMENT:,1.  Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment.  The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy  at the second metatarsal.  Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications.  The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well.,2.  The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date.,3.

He states that a little less than a year ago he developed pain in his right arm.  It is intermittent, but has persisted since that time.  He describes that he experiences a dull pain in his upper outer arm.  It occurs on a daily basis.  He also experiences an achy sensation in his right hand radiating to the fingers.  There is no numbness or paresthesias in the hand or arm.,He has had a 30-year history of neck pain.  He sought medical attention for this problem in 2006, when he developed ear pain.  This eventually led to him undergoing an MRI of the cervical spine, which showed some degenerative changes.  He was then referred to Dr. X for treatment of neck pain.  He has been receiving epidural injections under the care of Dr. X since 2007.  When I asked him what symptom he is receiving the injections for, he states that it is for neck pain and now the more recent onset of arm pain.  He also has taken several Medrol dose packs, which has caused his blood sugars to increase.  He is taking multiple other pain medications.  The pain does not interfere significantly with his quality of life, although he has a constant nagging pain.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , He has had diabetes since 2003.  He also has asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , He takes ACTOplus, albuterol, AndroGel, Astelin, Diovan, Dolgic Plus, aspirin 81 mg, fish oil, Lipitor, Lorazepam, multivitamins, Nasacort, Pulmicort, ranitidine, Singulair, Viagra, Zetia, Zyrtec, and Uroxatral.  He also uses Lidoderm patches and multiple eye drops and creams.,ALLERGIES:,  He states that Dyazide, Zithromax, and amoxicillin cause him to feel warm and itchy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  His father died from breast cancer.  He also had diabetes.  He has a strong family history of diabetes.  His mother is 89.  He has a sister with diabetes.  He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.,SOCIAL HISTORY:,  He lives alone.  He works full time in Human Resources for the State of Maryland.  He previously was an alcoholic, but quit in 1984.  He also quit smoking cigarettes in 1984, after 16 years of smoking.  He has a history of illicit drug use, but denies IV drug use.  He denies any HIV risk factors and states that his last HIV test was over two years ago.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , He has intermittent chest discomfort.  He has chronic tinnitus.  He has urinary dribbling.  Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above.  This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  HR 72. RR 16.,General Appearance:  Patient is well appearing, in no acute distress.,Cardiovascular:  There is a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  There are no carotid bruits.,Chest:  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.,Skin:  There are no rashes or lesions.,NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:,Mental Status:  Speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia.  The patient is alert and oriented to name, place, and date.  Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are all intact.,Cranial Nerves:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Optic discs are normal.  Visual fields are full.  Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus.  Facial sensation is normal.  There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.  Hearing is grossly intact.  Shoulder shrug is full.,Motor:  There is normal muscle bulk and tone.  There is no atrophy or fasciculations.  There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia.  Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities.,Sensory:  Sensation is intact to light touch, pinprick, temperature, vibratory sensation, and joint position sense.  Romberg is absent.,Coordination:  There is no dysmetria or ataxia on finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing.,Deep Tendon Reflexes:  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas and ankles.  Plantar reflexes are flexor.  There are no finger flexors, Hoffman's sign, or jaw jerk.,Gait and Stance:  Casual gait is normal.  Heel, toe, and tandem walking are all normal.,RADIOLOGIC DATA:,  MRI of the cervical spine, 05/19/08:  I personally reviewed this film, which showed narrowing of the foramen on the right at C4-C5 and other degenerative changes without central stenosis.,IMPRESSION:  ,The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with one-year history of right arm pain.  He also has a longstanding history of neck pain.  His neurological examination is normal.  He has an MRI that shows some degenerative changes.  I do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck.  However, I do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time.  Perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him.  I probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure, such as a spinal stimulator, as this pain really is minimal.  We could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage, although I think the likelihood is low.,2.  I gave him a prescription for Neurontin.  I discussed the side effects of the medication with him.,3.  We can discuss his case tomorrow at Spine Conference to see if there are any further recommendations."
 Urology, Overactive Bladder ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder.

No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms.  The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well.  At this point, what we will try is a different medication.  Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease.,IMPRESSION: , Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted.  She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued.  At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication.  She has never had any side effects from her medication.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue Ditropan.  We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled.  Otherwise we will continue to follow her urinalysis over the next year or so."

 Neurology, Cervical Spinal Stenosis ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Followup cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.  I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Afebrile to touch.,She ambulates with a normal gait.,Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.,Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus.  Hoffman sign normal bilaterally.,Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  Patellar reflex is 3 plus.  No clonus.,Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed.,They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease.  There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.  Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07.  She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Bronchoscopy & Foreign Body Removal ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Foreign body in airway.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Plastic piece foreign body in the right main stem bronchus.,PROCEDURE: , Rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , This patient is 7-month-old baby boy who presented to emergency room today with increasing stridor and shortness of breath according to mom.  The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem.  The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia.  Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea.  There were some secretions but that looked okay.  Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem.  I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself.  I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper.  It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object.  I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again.  Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out.  We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius.  There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area.  I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well.  I then withdrew the scope.  Trachea looked fine as well as the cords.  I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."
 Pediatrics - Neonatal, New Onset Seizure ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , New-onset seizure.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , She has undergone no surgical procedures.,FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: , There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.,General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.,HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.,Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.,Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.,Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.,Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.,Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.,Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.,ASSESSMENT:,  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.,2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.,3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.,4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then."
 Neurology, Craniopharyngioma - Postop ,"REASON FOR VISIT:,  Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Briefly, a 16-year-old right-handed boy who is in eleventh grade, who presents with some blurred vision and visual acuity difficulties, was found to have a suprasellar tumor.  He was brought to the operating room on 01/04/07, underwent a transsphenoidal resection of tumor.  Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.  There is some residual disease; however, the visual apparatus was decompressed.  According to him, he is doing well, back at school without any difficulties.  He has some occasional headaches and tinnitus, but his vision is much improved.,MEDICATIONS: , Synthroid 100 mcg per day.,FINDINGS: , On exam, he is awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  EOMs are full.  His visual acuity is 20/25 in the right (improved from 20/200) and the left is 20/200 improved from 20/400.  He has a bitemporal hemianopsia, which is significantly improved and wider.  His motor is 5 out of 5.  There are no focal motor or sensory deficits.  The abdominal incision is well healed.  There is no evidence of erythema or collection.  The lumbar drain was also well healed.,The postoperative MRI demonstrates small residual disease.,Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.,ASSESSMENT: , Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma with residual disease.,PLANS: , I have recommended that he call.  I discussed the options with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X. They will schedule the appointment to see him.  In addition, he probably will need an MRI prior to any treatment, to follow the residual disease."
 Gastroenterology, Diverticulectomy & Laparotomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Acute appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Perforated Meckel's diverticulum.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Diagnostic laparotomy.,2.  Exploratory laparotomy.,3.  Meckel's diverticulectomy.,4.  Open incidental appendectomy.,5.  Peritoneal toilet.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,300 ml.,URINE OUTPUT: , 200 ml.,TOTAL FLUID:,  1600 mL.,DRAIN:,  JP x1 right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum.,TUBES:,  Include an NG and a Foley catheter.,SPECIMENS: , Include Meckel's diverticulum and appendix.,COMPLICATIONS: , Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with hypoxemia following closure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 45-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented to ABCD General Hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain that began 24 hours prior to this evaluation.,The pain was very vague and progressed in intensity.  The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite.  His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4.  He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen.  The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There was large amounts of purulent drainage.  The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed.  The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created.  The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation.  The instruments were then removed.  The abdomen was then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.,The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.,The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected.  There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well.  Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed.  The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.,The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.  To remain on IV antibiotics and we will manage ventilatory-dependency of the patient."

Examination at the time of this admission demonstrated peeling of the skin and excoriation between all of his toes on both feet consistent with tinea pedis.,PAST MEDICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY:,  As per the admission record.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , As per the admission record.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ,As per the admission record.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , At the time of admission, his white blood cell count was 8200 with a normal differential, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 40.6 with normal indices, and platelet count was 250,000.  Comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable, except for a nonfasting blood sugar of 137, lactic acid was 0.8.  Urine demonstrated 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria.  Blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable.  Chest x-ray was unremarkable.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was admitted to the General Medical floor and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical Lotrimin.  On this regimen, his lower extremity edema and erythema resolved quite rapidly.,Because of urinary frequency, a bladder scan was done suggesting about 600 cc of residual urine.  A Foley catheter was inserted and was productive of approximately 500 cc of urine.  The patient was prescribed Flomax 0.4 mg daily.  24 hours later, the Foley catheter was removed and a bladder scan demonstrated 60 cc of residual urine after approximately eight hours.,At the time of this dictation, the patient was ambulating minimally, however, not sufficiently to resume independent living."
 Urology, Prostatectomy - Robotic Radical Retropubic ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Adenocarcinoma of the prostate.,PROCEDURE,1.  Radical retropubic prostatectomy, robotic assisted.,2.  Bladder suspension.,ANESTHESIA:,  General by intubation.,The patient understands his diagnosis, grade, stage and prognosis.  He understands this procedure, options to it and potential benefits from it.  He strongly wishes to proceed.  He accepts all treatment-associated risks to include but not be limited to bleeding requiring transfusion; infection; sepsis; heart attack; stroke; bladder neck contractures; need to convert to an open procedure; urinary fistulae; impotence; incontinence; injury to bowel/rectum/bladder/ureters, etc.; small-bowel obstruction; abdominal hernia; osteitis pubis/chronic pelvic pain, etc.,DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room, given a successful general anesthetic, placed in the lithotomy position, prepped with Betadine solutions and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision.  My assistant was on the right.  The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas.  The ampullae were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply.  Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis was found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control.  This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl.  The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case."
 Urology, Penile Prosthesis Replacement ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis.,2.  Peyronie's disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis.,2.  Peyronie's disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700.,ANESTHESIA:,  General LMA.,SPECIMEN: , Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis.,PROCEDURE:  ,This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for years for him, but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  There was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This was also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter was used or placed.,The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt.  Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr. Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics."
 Hematology - Oncology, Cholangiocarcinoma Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:,  Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009.  Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.  Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound.  She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm.  She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct.  She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP.  On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.  Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization.  She was also noted to have an elevated CA99.  She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation.  After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair.

Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop.  He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours.  She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia.  She has two adult sons who are in good health.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years.  Her first husband died in 1995.  She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  ,The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed.  She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well.  She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms.  As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.  She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.

 Orthopedic, Radiofrequency Ablation ,"PROCEDURE: , Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation.,INDICATION: , Sacroiliac joint pain.,INFORMED CONSENT: , The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.,The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.,The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.,PROCEDURE: , Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.,The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.,With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.,The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.,All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.,ADDITIONAL DETAILS:  ,None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DISCUSSION: , Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.,The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.,Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary," Heart Catheterization, Ventriculography, & Angiography - 3 ","NAME OF PROCEDURE: , Left heart catheterization with ventriculography, selective coronary angiography.,INDICATIONS: , Acute coronary syndrome.,TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: , Standard Judkins, right groin.

 Orthopedic, Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair - 2 ,"PROCEDURES,1.  Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.,2.  Arthroscopic subacromial decompression.,3.  Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified.  The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic.  Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed.  It revealed no patholigamentous laxity.  The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position.  We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times.  The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.,Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery.  We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle.  This consisted of 60 cc of fluid.  We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion.  Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint.  Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed.  We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint.,We found the articular surface to be in good condition.  There was a superior labral tear (SLAP).  This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal.  We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear.  We then drained the glenohumeral joint.  We redirected our camera into the subacromial space.  An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior.,We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver.  The bursa was extensively debrided.  We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached.  The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair.  Pictures were taken.,Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed.  It was carefully positioned.  Pictures were taken.  We then drained the joint.  All instruments were removed.  The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively.  All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures.,Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump.  ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied.  A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder.  The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax.  The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.  I then went out and spoke with the family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Endovascular Brachytherapy ,"ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT),The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis.  The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.  After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter.  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy.  The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter.  Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function."
 Urology, Inguinal Hernia Repair - 6 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right inguinal hernia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right inguinal hernia.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE:  ,Right inguinal hernia repair.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity.  He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair.  We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia.  All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right.  The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy.  Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution.  During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure.  I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision.  An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block.  A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique.  After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated.  The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained.  Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed.  I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective.  I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced.  The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  Blood loss was less than 5 mL.  The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition."

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of comminuted C2 fracture.,2.  Posterior spinal instrumentation C1-C3, using Synthes system.,3.  Posterior cervical fusion C1-C3.,4.  Insertion of morselized allograft at C1to C3.,ANESTHESIA:,  GETA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  100 mL.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,DRAINS: , Hemovac x1.,Spinal cord monitoring is stable throughout the entire case.,DISPOSITION:,  Vital signs are stable, extubated and taken back to the ICU in a satisfactory and stable condition.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:,  The patient is a middle-aged female, who has had a significantly displaced C2 comminuted fracture.  This is secondary to a motor vehicle accident and it was translated appropriately 1 cm.  Risks and benefits have been conferred with the patient as well as the family, they wish to proceed.  The patient was taken to the operating room for a C1-C3 posterior cervical fusion, instrumentation, open reduction and internal fixation.,OPERATION IN DETAIL: , After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #5.  The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated and under general anesthesia without any difficulties.  Spinal cord monitoring was induced.  No changes were seen from the beginning to the end of the case.,Mayfield tongues were placed appropriately.  This was placed in line with the pinna of the ear as well as a cm above the tip of the earlobes.  The patient was subsequently rolled onto the fluoroscopic OSI table in the usual prone position with chest rolls.  The patient's Mayfield tongue was fixated in the usual standard fashion.  The patient was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Midline incision was extended from the base of the skull down to the C4 spinous process.  Full thickness skin fascia developed.  The fascia was incised at midline and the posterior elements at C1, C2, C3, as well as the inferior aspect of the occiput was exposed.  Intraoperative x-ray confirmed the level to be C2.,Translaminar screws were placed at C2 bilaterally.  Trajectory was completed with a hand drill and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of pedicles and once this was done, two 3.5 mm translaminar screws were placed bilaterally at C2.  Good placement was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy.  Facet screws were then placed at C3.  Using standard technique of Magerl, starting in the inferomedial quadrant 14 mm trajectories in the 25-degree caudad-cephalad direction as well as 25 degrees in the medial lateral direction was made.  This was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there is no elevation of the trajectory.  A 14 x 3.5 mm screws were then placed appropriately.  Lateral masteries at C1 endplate were placed appropriately.  The medial and lateral borders were demarcated with a Penfield.  The great occipital nerve was retracted out the way.  Starting point was made with a high-speed power bur and midline and lateral mass bilaterally.  Using a 20-degree caudad-cephalad trajectory as well as 10-degree lateral-to-medial direction, the trajectory was completed in 8 mm increments, this was subsequently sounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall of the trajectory.  Once this was done, 24 x 3.5 mm smooth Schanz screws were placed appropriately.  Precontoured titanium rods were then placed between the screws at the C1, C2, C3 and casts were placed appropriately.  Once this was done, all end caps were appropriately torqued.  This completed the open reduction and internal fixation of the C2 fracture, which showed perfect alignment.  It must be noted that the reduction was partially performed on the table using lateral fluoroscopy prior to the instrumentation, almost reducing the posterior vertebral margin of the odontoid fracture with the base of the C2 access.  Once the screws were torqued bilaterally, good alignment was seen both in the AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy, this completed instrumentation as well as open reduction and internal fixation of C2.  The cervical fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements of C1, C2, and C3.  Once this was done, the morselized allograft 30 mL of cortical cancellous bone chips with 10 mL of demineralized bone matrix was placed over the decorticated elements.  The fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl suture figure-of-8.  Superficial drain was placed appropriately.  Good alignment of the instrumentation as well as of the fracture was seen both in the AP and lateral planes.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed using a #2-0 Vicryl suture.  The dermal edges were approximated using staples.  The wound was then dressed sterilely using Bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4x4s, and tape, and the drain was connected appropriately.  The patient was subsequently released with a Mayfield contraption and rolled on to the stretcher in the usual supine position.  Mayfield tongues were subsequently released.  No significant bleeding was appreciated.  The patient was subsequently extubated uneventfully and taken back to the recovery room in satisfactory and stable condition.  No complications arose."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, CABG x4 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: , Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,  Progressive exertional angina, three-vessel coronary artery disease, left main disease, preserved left ventricular function.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4.,GRAFTS PERFORMED: , LIMA to LAD, left radial artery from the aorta to the PDA, left saphenous vein graft from the aorta sequential to the diagonal to the obtuse marginal.,INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman, who presented with six-month history of progressively worsening exertional angina.  He had a positive stress test and cardiac cath showed severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease including left main disease with preserved LV function.  He was advised surgical revascularization of his coronaries.,FINDINGS DURING THE PROCEDURE:  ,The aorta was free of any significant plaque in the ascending portion at the sites of cannulation and cross clamp.  Left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts were good quality conduits.  Radial artery graft was a smaller sized conduit, otherwise good quality.  All distal targets showed heavy plaque involvement with calcification present.  The smallest target was the PDA, which was about 1.5 mm in size.  All the other targets were about 2 mm in size or greater.  The patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  He was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, Precedex drips.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes, bypass time was 120 minutes.,DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought into the operating room and laid supine on the table.  After he had been interfaced with the appropriate monitors, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced and invasive monitoring lines including right IJ triple-lumen catheter and Cordis catheter, right radial A-line, Foley catheter, TEE probes were placed and interfaced appropriately.  The patient was then prepped and draped from chin to bilateral ankles including the left forearm in the usual sterile fashion.  Preoperative checkup of the left forearm has revealed good collateral filling from the ulnar with the radial occluded thus indicating good common arch and thus left radial artery was suitable for harvest.,After prepping and draping the patient from the chin to bilateral ankles including left forearm in the usual sterile fashion, proper time-out was conducted and site identification was performed, and subsequently incision was made overlying the sternum and median sternotomy was performed.  Left internal mammary artery was taken down.  Simultaneously, left forearm radial artery was harvested using endoscopic harvesting techniques.  Simultaneously, endoscopic left leg saphenous vein was harvested using endoscopic minimally invasive techniques.  Subsequent to harvest, the incisions were closed in layers during the course of the procedure.,Heparin was given.  Pericardium was opened and suspended.  During the takedown of the left internal mammary artery, it was noted that the left pleural space was globally softened and left lung was adherent to the chest wall and mediastinum globally.  Only a limited dissection was performed to free up the lung from the mediastinal structures to accommodate the left internal mammary artery.,Pericardium was opened and suspended.  Pursestring sutures were placed.  Aortic and venous as well as antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia cannulation was performed and the patient was placed on cardiopulmonary bypass.  With satisfactory flow, the aorta was cross clamped and the heart was arrested using a combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia.  An initial dose of about 1500 mL was given and this was followed by intermittent doses given both antegrade and retrograde throughout the procedure to maintain a good arrest and to protect the heart.,PDA was exposed first.  The right coronary artery was calcified along its course all the way to its terminal bifurcation.  Even in the PDA, calcification was noted in a spotty fashion.  Arteriotomy on the PDA was performed in a soft area and 1.5 probe was noted to be accommodated in both directions.  End radial to side PDA anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, the posterolateral obtuse marginal was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end saphenous vein to side obtuse marginal anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  This graft was then apposed to the diagonal and corresponding arteriotomy and venotomies were performed and a diamond shaped side-to-side anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  Next, a slit was made in the left side of the pericardium and LIMA was accommodated in the slit on its way to the LAD.  LAD was exposed.  Arteriotomy was performed.  An end LIMA to side LAD anastomosis was constructed using running 7-0 Prolene.  LIMA was tacked down to the epicardium securely utilizing its fascial pedicle.,Two stab incisions were made in the ascending aorta and enlarged using 4-mm punch.  Two proximal anastomosis were constructed between the proximal end of the saphenous vein graft and the side of the aorta, and the proximal end of the radial artery graft and the side of the aorta separately using running 6-0 Prolene.  The patient was given terminal dose of warm retrograde followed by antegrade cardioplegia during which de-airing maneuvers were performed.  Following this, the aortic cross clamp was removed and the heart was noted to resume spontaneous coordinated contractile activity.  Temporary V-pacing wires were placed.  Blake drains were placed in the left chest, the right chest, as well as in the mediastinum.  Left chest Blake drain was placed just in the medial section where dissection had been performed.  After an adequate period of rewarming during which time, temporary V-pacing wires were also placed, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without any problems.  With satisfactory hemodynamics, good LV function on TEE and baseline EKG, heparin was reversed using protamine.  Decannulation was performed after volume resuscitation.  Hemostasis was assured.  Mediastinal and pericardial fat and pericardium were loosely reapproximated in the midline and chest was closed in layers using interrupted stainless steel wires to reappose the two sternal halves, heavy Vicryl for musculofascial closure, and Monocryl for subcuticular skin closure.  Dressings were applied.  The patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  He tolerated the procedure well.  All counts were correct at the termination of the procedure.  Cross clamp time was 102 minutes.  Bypass time was 120 minutes.  The patient was transferred on Neo-Synephrine, nitroglycerin, and Precedex drips."
 Urology, Cysto Stent Removal ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent.,OPERATION:,  Cysto stent removal.,ANESTHESIA:,  Local MAC.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,FLUIDS: , Crystalloid.,MEDICATIONS: , The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose.  The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.  Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm ,"POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm.,OPERATION/PROCEDURE: , A 26-mm Dacron graft replacement of type 4 thoracoabdominal aneurysm from T10 to the bifurcation of the aorta, re-implanting the celiac, superior mesenteric artery and right renal as an island and the left renal as a 8-mm interposition Dacron graft, utilizing left heart bypass and cerebrospinal fluid drainage.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Patient was brought to the operating room and put in supine position, and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced through a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  Patient was placed in the thoracoabdominal position with the left chest up and the hips back to a 30-degree angle.  The left groin, abdominal and chest were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A thoracoabdominal incision was made.  The 8th interspace was entered.  The costal margin was divided.  The retroperitoneal space was entered and bluntly dissected free to the psoas, bringing all the peritoneal contents to the midline, exposing the aorta.  The inferior pulmonary ligament was then taken down so the aorta could be dissected free at the T10 level just above the diaphragm.  It was dissected free circumferentially.  The aortic bifurcation was dissected free, dissecting free both iliac arteries.  The left inferior pulmonary vein was then dissected free, and a pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on this.  The patient was heparinized.  Through a stab wound in the center of this, a right-angle venous cannula was then placed at the left atrium and secured to a Rumel tourniquet.  This was hooked to a venous inflow of left heart bypass machine.  A pursestring of 4-0 Prolene was placed on the aneurysm and through a stab wound in the center of this, an arterial cannula was placed and hooked to outflow.  Bypass was instituted.  The aneurysm was cross clamped just above T10 and also, cross clamped just below the diaphragm.  The area was divided at this point.  A 26-mm graft was then sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  The graft was brought into the diaphragm.  Clamps were then placed on the iliacs, and the pump was shut off.  The aorta was opened longitudinally, going posterior between the left and right renal arteries, and it was completely transected at its bifurcation.  The SMA, celiac and right renal artery were then dissected free as a complete island, and the left renal was dissected free as a complete Carrell patch.  The island was laid in the graft for the visceral liner, and it was sutured in place with running 4-0 Prolene suture with pledgetted 4-0 Prolene sutures around the circumference.  The clamp was then moved below the visceral vessels, and the clamp on the chest was removed, re-establishing flow to the visceral vessels.  The graft was cut to fit the bifurcation and sutured in place with running 3-0 Prolene suture.  All clamps were removed, and flow was re-established.  An 8-mm graft was sutured end-to-end to the Carrell patch and to the left renal.  A partial-occlusion clamp was placed.  An area of graft was removed.  The end of the graft was cut to fit this and sutured in place with running Prolene suture.  The partial-occlusion clamp was removed.  Protamine was given.  Good hemostasis was noted.  The arterial cannula, of course, had been removed when that part of the aneurysm was removed.  The venous cannula was removed and oversewn with a 4-0 Prolene suture.  Good hemostasis was noted.  A 36 French posterior and a 32 French anterior chest tube were placed.  The ribs were closed with figure-of-eight #2 Vicryl.  The fascial layer was closed with running #1 Prolene, subcu with running 2-0 Dexon and the skin with running 4-0 Dexon subcuticular stitch.  Patient tolerated the procedure well."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Cardiac Catheterization ,"EXAMINATION: , Cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Left heart catheterization, LV cineangiography, selective coronary angiography, and right heart catheterization with cardiac output by thermodilution technique with dual transducer.,INDICATION: , Syncope with severe aortic stenosis.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization laboratory in a post observed state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After adequate conscious sedation and local anesthesia was obtained, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and a 8-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral vein.  Following this, a 7.5-French Swan-Ganz catheter was advanced into the right atrium where the right atrial pressure was 10/7 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the right ventricle where the right ventricular pressure was 37/10/4 mmHg.  The catheter was then manipulated into the wedge position where the wedge pressure was noted to be 22 mmHg.  The pulmonary arterial pressures were noted to be 31/14/21 mmHg.  Following this, the catheter was removed, the sheath was flushed and a 6-French JL4 diagnostic catheter was the advanced over the guidewire and the left main coronary artery was cannulated and selective angiogram was obtained in orthogonal views.  Following this, the catheter was exchanged over the guidewire for 6-French JR4 diagnostic catheter.  We were unable to cannulate the right coronary artery.  Therefore, we exchanged for a Williams posterior catheter and we were able to cannulate the right coronary artery and angiographs were performed in orthogonal views.  Following this, this catheter was exchanged over a guidewire for a 6-French Langston pigtail catheter and the left ventricle was entered and left ventriculography was performed.  Following this, the catheters were removed.  Sheath angiograms revealed the sheath to be in the right common femoral artery and the right common femoral arteriotomy was sealed using a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.,DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: , The left main coronary artery is a large vessel, which bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left circumflex artery is a short vessel, which gives off one major obtuse marginal artery and has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left anterior descending artery has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities and gives off two major diagonal branches.  There is a 70% ostial lesion in the first diagonal branch and the second diagonal branch has mild-to-moderate luminal irregularities.  The right coronary artery is a very large dominant vessel with a 60% to 70% lesion in its descending mid-portion.  The remainder of the vessel has moderate diffuse luminal irregularities with no critical lesions.  The left ventricle appears to be normal sized.  The aortic valve is heavily calcified.  The estimated ejection fraction is approximately 60%.  There was 4+ mitral regurgitation noted.  The mean gradient across the aortic valve was noted to be 33 mmHg yielding an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,CONCLUSION:,1.  Moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease with a high-grade lesion seen at the ostium of the first diagonal artery as well as a 60% to 70% lesion seen at the mid portion of the right coronary artery.,2.  Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.89 cm2.,3.  4+ mitral regurgitation.,PLAN: , The patient will most likely need a transesophageal echocardiogram to better evaluate the valvular architecture and the patient will be referred to Dr Kenneth Fang for possible aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve repair/replacement and possible surgical revascularization."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Consult - Palpitations & Presyncope ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a charming and delightful 46-year-old woman admitted with palpitations and presyncope.,The patient is active and a previously healthy young woman, who has had nine years of occasional palpitations.  Symptoms occur three to four times per year and follow no identifiable pattern.  She has put thought and effort in trying to identify precipitating factors or circumstances but has been unable to do so.  Symptoms can last for an hour or more and she feels as if her heart is going very rapidly but has never measured her heart rate.  The last two episodes, the most recent of which was yesterday, were associated with feeling of darkness descending as if a shade was being pulled down in front of her vision.  On neither occasion did she lose consciousness.,Yesterday, she had a modestly active morning taking a walk with her dogs and performing her normal routines.  While working on a computer, she had a spell.  Palpitations persisted for a short time thereafter as outlined in the hospital's admission note prompting her to seek evaluation at the hospital.  She was in sinus rhythm on arrival and has been asymptomatic since.,No history of exogenous substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or caffeine abuse.  She does have a couple of sodas and at least one to two coffees daily.  She is a nonsmoker.  She is a mother of two.  There is no family history of congenital heart disease.  She has had no history of thoracic trauma.  No symptoms to suggest thyroid disease.,No known history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.  Family history is negative for ischemic heart disease.,Remote history is significant for an ACL repair, complicated by contact urticaria from a neoprene cast.,No regular medications prior to admission.,The only allergy is the neoprene reaction outlined above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Vital signs as charted.  Pupils are reactive.  Sclerae nonicteric.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck veins not distended.  No bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam is regular without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen is soft without guarding, rebound masses, or bruits.  Extremities well perfused.  No edema.  Strong and symmetrical distal pulses.,A 12-lead EKG shows sinus rhythm with normal axis and intervals.  No evidence of preexcitation.,LABORATORY STUDIES: , Unremarkable.  No evidence of myocardial injury.  Thyroid function is pending.,Two-dimensional echocardiogram shows no evidence of clinically significant structural or functional heart disease.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , Episodic palpitations over a nine-year period.  Outpatient workup would be appropriate.  Event recorder should be obtained and the patient can be seen again in the office upon completion of that study.  Suppressive medication (beta-blocker or Cardizem) was discussed with the patient for symptomatic improvement, though this would be unlikely to be a curative therapy.  The patient expresses a preference to avoid medical therapy if possible.,Thank you for this consultation.  We will be happy to follow her both during this hospitalization and following discharge.  Caffeine avoidance was discussed as well.,ADDENDUM: , During her initial evaluation, a D-dimer was mildly elevated to 5.  CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  Lower extremity venous ultrasound is pending; however, in the absence of embolization to the pulmonary vasculature, this would be an unlikely cause of palpitations.  In addition, no progression over the nine-year period that she has been symptomatic suggests that this is an unlikely cause.,"

 Pediatrics - Neonatal, Inguinal Hernia & Hydrocele Repair ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Left communicating hydrocele.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left communicating hydrocele.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,PROCEDURE:  ,Left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 5-year-old young man with fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis and peritesticular space on the left side consistent with a communicating hydrocele.  The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  ,The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: , The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.  After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine.  A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.

The patient had appropriate oxygen, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate monitoring applied and monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula was applied to the nasopharynx with 100% saturations achieved.  Topical anesthesia with 10 cc of 4% Xylocaine was applied to the right nares and oropharynx.  Subsequent to this, the patient was premedicated with 50 mg of Demerol and then Versed 1 mg sequentially for a total of 2 mg.  With this, adequate consciousness sedation was achieved.  3 cc of 4% viscous Xylocaine was applied to the right nares.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the right nares into the nasopharynx and oropharynx.,The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and showed mild erythema, mild edema, otherwise negative.,There was normal vocal cord motion without masses or lesions.  Additional topical anesthesia with 2% Xylocaine was applied to the larynx and subsequently throughout the tracheobronchial tree for a total of 18 cc.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea.  The trachea showed mild evidence of erythema and moderate amounts of clear frothy secretions.  These were suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the carina, which was sharp.  Then advanced into the left main stem and each segment, subsegement in the left upper lingula and lower lobe was visualized.  There was mild tracheobronchitis with mild friability throughout.  There was modest amounts of white secretion.  There were no other findings including evidence of mass, anatomic distortions, or hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and advanced into the right mainstem.  Again, each segment and subsegment was well visualized.  The right upper lobe anatomy showed some segmental distortion with dilation and irregularities both at the apical region as well as in the subsegments of the anteroapical and posterior segments.  No specific masses or other lesions were identified throughout the tracheobronchial tree on the right.  There was mild tracheal bronchitis with friability.  Upon coughing, there was punctate hemorrhage.  The bronchoscope was then advanced through the bronchus intermedius and the right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  These again had no other anatomic lesions identified.  The bronchoscope was then wedged in the right middle lobe and bronchoalveolar samples were obtained.  The bronchoscope was withdrawn and the area was suctioned clear.  The bronchoscope was then advanced into the apical segment of the right upper lobe and the bronchioalveolar lavage again performed.  Samples were taken and the bronchoscope was removed suctioned the area clear.  The bronchoscope was then re-advanced into the right lower lobe and multiple transbronchial biopsies were taken under fluoroscopic guidance in the posterior and lateral segments of the right lower lobe.  Minimal hemorrhage was identified and suctioned clear without difficulty.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the mainstem.  The area was suctioned clear.  Fluoroscopy revealed no evidence of pneumothorax.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without evidence of desaturation or complications."

 Gastroenterology, GI Consultation - 2 ,"PROBLEM:  ,Chronic abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abnormal liver function tests., ,HISTORY: , The patient is a 23-year-old female referred for evaluation due to a chronic history of abdominal pain and extensive work-up for abnormal liver function tests and this chronic nausea and vomiting referred here for further evaluation due to the patient's recent move from Eugene to Portland.  The patient is not a great historian.  Most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her.  According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr.  A in August 2001.  It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past."

 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Aortobifemoral Bypass ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Aortoiliac occlusive disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:, Aortoiliac occlusive disease.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:, Aortobifemoral bypass.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was taken to the operating room.  The abdominal contents were within normal limits.  The aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis.  A 16x8 mm Gore-Tex graft was placed without difficulty.  The femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing, but satisfactory bypass was performed.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in a supine position, and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with Betadine solution.  A longitudinal incision was made after a Betadine-coated drape was placed over the incisional area.  Longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges.  Attention was then turned to the abdomen, where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid, carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  The abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery.  Mild adhesions were lysed.  The omentum was freed.  The small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities.  The liver and gallbladder were within normal limits.  No abnormalities were noted.  At this point, the Bookwalter retractor was placed.  NG tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction.  The intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally.  The rest of the peritoneum was then opened.  The aorta was cleared, both proximally and distally.  The left iliac was completely occluded.  The right iliac was to be cleansed.  At this point, 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect.  The aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion.  A single lumbar was ligated with #3-0 Prolene.  The inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure.  Care was taken to preserve collaterals.  The aorta was measured, and a 16 mm Gore-Tex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using #3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Last stitch was tied.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The clamp was gradually removed and additional Prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis.  At this point, strong pulses were present within the graft.  The limbs were vented and irrigated.  Using bimanual technique, the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin.  The grafts were then brought through these, care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft.  At this point, the right iliac was then ligated using #0 Vicryl and the clamp was removed.  Hemostasis was excellent.  The right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally, opened with #11 blade extended with Potts scissors.  The graft was _____ and anastomosed to the artery using #5-0 Prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch _______ running fashion.  Prior to tying the last stitch, the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied.  Flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results.  Attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed, cleared proximally and distally.  The artery was opened, extended with a Potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with #5-0 Prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis.  The last stitch was tied.  Strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself.  At this point, 25 mg of protamine was administered.  The wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution.  The groins were repacked.  Attention was then returned to the abdomen.  The retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present.  The shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft.  The intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position.  There was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel.  At this point, the omentum and stomach were repositioned.  The abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using #1 PDS.  The skin was closed with skin staples.  The groins were again irrigated, closed with #3-0 Vicryl and #4-0 undyed Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient was then taken into the recovery room in satisfactory condition after tolerating the procedure well.  Sponges and instrument counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss 900 cc."
 Gastroenterology, Wound Check - Status Post APR ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check.  The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: , Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time."
 Obstetrics / Gynecology, Delivery Note - 1 ,"The patient presented in the early morning hours of February 12, 2007, with contractions.  The patient was found to be in false versus early labor and managed as an outpatient.  The patient returned to labor and delivery approximately 12 hours later with regular painful contractions.  There was minimal cervical dilation, but 80% effacement by nurse examination.  The patient was admitted.  Expected management was utilized initially.  Stadol was used for analgesia.  Examination did not reveal vulvar lesions.  Epidural was administered.  Membranes ruptured spontaneously.  Cervical dilation progressed.  Acceleration-deceleration complexes were seen.  Overall, fetal heart tones remained reassuring during the progress of labor.  The patient was allowed to ""labor down"" during second stage.  Early decelerations were seen as well as acceleration-deceleration complexes.  Overall, fetal heart tones were reassuring.  Good maternal pushing effort produced progressive descent.,Spontaneous controlled sterile vaginal delivery was performed without episiotomy and accomplished without difficulty.  Fetal arm was wrapped at the level of the neck with the fetal hand and also at the level of the neck.  There was no loop or coil of cord.  Infant was vigorous female sex.  Oropharynx was aggressively aspirated.  Cord blood was obtained.  Placenta delivered spontaneously.,Following delivery, uterus was explored without findings of significant tissue.  Examination of the cervix did not reveal lacerations.  Upper vaginal lacerations were not seen.  Multiple first-degree lacerations were present.  Specific locations included the vestibula at 5 o'clock, left labia minora with short extension up the left sulcus, right anterior labia minora at the vestibule, and midline of the vestibule.  All mucosal lacerations were reapproximated with interrupted simple sutures of 4-0 Vicryl with the knots being buried.  Post-approximation examination of the rectum showed smooth, intact mucosa.  Blood loss with the delivery was 400 mL.,Plans for postpartum care include routine postpartum orders.  Nursing personnel will be notified of Gilbert's syndrome."

Note that previously the patient was found to have some baseline dementia, although slight.  The patient was seen and evaluated by the neurology team, who cleared the patient for surgery.  The patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  We first began our dissection by using a #10-blade scalpel to incise the skin over the femoral artery in the groin bilaterally.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the femoral vessels using Bovie electrocautery.  The common femoral, superficial femoral, and profunda femoris arteries were encircled and dissected out peripherally.  Vessel loops were placed around the aforementioned arteries.  After doing so, we turned our attention to beginning our abdominal dissection.  We used a #10-blade scalpel to make a midline laparotomy incision.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the fascia using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened and an Omni retractor was positioned.  The aorta was dissected out in the abdomen.  The left femoral vein was identified.  There was a nicely clampable portion of aorta visible.  We, as mentioned, placed our Omni retractor and then turned our attention to performing our anastomosis.  Full-dose heparin was given.  Next, vascular clamps were applied to the iliac vessels as well as to the proximal aorta just below the renal vessels.  A #11-blade scalpel was used to make an arteriotomy in the aorta, which was lengthened both proximally and distally using Potts scissors.  We then beveled our proximal graft and constructed an end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 3-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed our graft and noted there was no evidence of a leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We then created our tunnels over the iliac vessels.  We pulled the distal limbs over our ABF graft into the groin.  We then proceeded to perform our right anastomosis first.  We applied vascular clamps on the proximal common femoral, profunda, and superficial femoral arteries.  We incised the common femoral artery and lengthened our arteriotomy in the vessel both proximally and distally.  We then footed the graft down onto the common femoral artery to the level of the SFA and constructed our anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we flushed the common femoral, SFA, and profunda femoris arteries.  We then removed our clamp.  We opened the limb more proximally in the abdomen on the right side.  We then turned our attention to the left side and similarly placed our vascular clamps.  We used a #11-blade scalpel to make an arteriotomy in the vessel.  We then lengthened our arteriotomy both proximally and distally again onto the SFA.  We constructed a footed end graft-to-side artery anastomosis using 6-0 Prolene in a running fashion.  Upon completion of our anastomosis, we opened our clamps.  There was no noticeable leak from the newly constructed anastomosis.  We checked our proximal graft to aortic anastomosis, which was noted to be in good condition.  We then gave full-dose protamine.  We closed the peritoneum over the graft with 4-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The abdomen was closed with #1 nylon in a running fashion.  The skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at end of case.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit in good condition."

The problem has been progressive in nature.  The preoperative discussion with the patient included alternative treatment options, the procedure was explained, and the risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and the postoperative management were discussed.  The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patient have less pain and improved function, all questions were thoroughly answered.  The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interfere with normal daily activity.  The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate pain and discomfort.,DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was given 1 g of Ancef IV for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure.  The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  No tourniquet was utilized.  IV sedation was achieved followed by a local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site.  The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Balanced anesthesia was obtained.,PROCEDURE:, Closing wedge osteotomy, fifth metatarsal with internal screw fixation, right foot.  A dorsal curvilinear incision was made extending from the base of the proximal phalanx fifth digit to a point 1.5 cm from the base of the fifth metatarsal.  Care was taken to identify and retract all vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery.  The extensor tendon was identified and retracted medially.  Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue down to the periosteal layer.  A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision.  The capsular tissue and periosteal layer was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  Inspection of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint revealed articular cartilage to be perverse and hypertrophic changes to the lateral and dorsolateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head.  An oscillating saw was utilized to carefully resect the hypertrophic portion of the fifth metatarsal head to a more normal configuration.  The both edges were rasped smooth.,Attention was then focused on the fifth metatarsal.  The periosteal layer proximal to the fifth metatarsal head was underscored, free from its underlying attachment, and then reflected to expose the osseous surface.  An excess guide position perpendicular to the weightbearing surface was placed to define apex of the osteotomy.,Using an oscillating saw, a vertically placed, wedge-shaped oblique ostomy was made with the apex being proximal, lateral, and the base medial and distal.  Generous amounts of lateral cortex were preserved for the lateral hinge.  The wedge was removed from the surgical field.  The fifth metatarsal was placed in the appropriate position and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then countersunk and a 3-0 x 40 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position.  Good purchase was noted at the osteotomy site.  Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the fourth intermetatarsal angle with the fifth metatarsal in good alignment and position.  The surgical site was flushed with copious amounts of normal saline irrigation.  The periosteal and capsular layers were closed with running sutures of 3-0 Vicryl.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed with 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin edges were closed with 4-0 nylon in a running interrupted fashion.  A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, confirming bandages, and ACE wrap to provide mild compression was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to the recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by normal capillary refill time, and all digits were warm and pink.,A walker boot was dispensed and applied.  The patient should wear that all the time when standing or walking and be nonweightbearing with crutches and to clear by me.,Office visit will be in 4 days.  The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg one p.o. t.i.d. for 10 days and Ultram ER, #15 one p.o. daily along with written and oral home instructions including a number on which I can be reached 24 hours a day if any problem arises.,After short recuperative period, the patient was discharged home with a vital sign stable in no acute distress."

Here, the proposed scalp incision was infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and then a zigzag scalp incision was made from one ear to the other ear, posterior to the coronal suture.  Scalp incision was reflected anteriorly and then the periosteum was taken off of the bone and then the temporalis muscles were reflected anterolaterally until the anterior cranial vault was exposed and then the periorbital rim, nasion and orbital part of the zygomatic arch were all dissected out as well as the pterion.  Using a craniotome, several bur holes were made; two on the either side of the midline posteriorly and then two posterolaterally.  The two posterior bur holes were then connected with a punch over the superior sagittal sinus and then the craniotome was used to fashion a flap first on the left and then on the right, going paramedian along the superior sagittal sinus in the midline and then curving over the fronto-orbital bar.  We then dissected superior sagittal sinus off of the inner table of the right bundle flap and then connected the right bundle flap going across the pterion on the right, which was abnormal.  The pterion on the right was then run short down after removing both bone flaps and then the dura was dissected off from the orbital roofs.  On the right, the orbital roof was jagged and abnormal and we had to repair a CSF leak from where the dura was punctured by the orbital roof.  The orbital rim was then dissected out and then using the saw and chisels, we were able to make the releasing cuts to free up the orbital rims, zygomatic arch and then remove the orbital bar going posteriorly and then the distal bar was split in the middle and then reapproximated with a bone graft in the middle to move the orbits out a little bit and the orbital bar was held together using absorbable plate.  It was then replaced and advanced and then relaxing, barrel-staving incisions were made in the bone flaps and the orbital rim and it was held on the right side with an absorbable plate to fix it in the proper position.  The bone flaps were then reapproximated using absorbable plates and screws, as well as #2-0 Vicryl to secure back into place.  Some of the places were also secured in the midline posteriorly, as well as off to the right where the bony defects were in place.  The periosteum was then brought over the skull and fastened in place and the temporalis muscles were tacked up to the periosteum.  The wounds were irrigated out.  A drain was left in posteriorly and then the wounds were closed in a routine manner using Vicryl for the galea and fast-absorbing gut for the skin followed by sterile dressings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did receive blood transfusions."

No central embolism.  The proximal subsegmental pulmonary arteries are free of embolus, but the distal subsegmental and segmental arteries especially on the right are limited by extensive pulmonary parenchymal, findings would be discussed in more detail below.  There is no evidence of a central embolism.,As seen on the prior examination, there is a very large heterogeneous right chest wall mass, which measures at least 10 x 12 cm based on axial image #35.  Just superior to the mass is a second heterogeneous focus of neoplasm measuring about 5 x 3.3 cm.  Given the short interval time course from the prior exam, dated 01/23/09, this finding has not significantly changed.  However, there is considerable change in the appearance of the lung fields.  There are now bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the left with associated atelectasis.  There are also extensive right lung consolidations, all new or increased significantly from the prior examination.  Again identified is a somewhat spiculated region of increased density at the right lung apex, which may indicate fibrosis or scarring, but the possibility of primary or metastatic disease cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax in the interval.,On the mediastinal windows, there is presumed subcarinal adenopathy, with one lymph node measuring roughly 12 mm suggestive of metastatic disease here.  There is aortic root and arch and descending thoracic aortic calcification.  There are scattered regions of soft plaque intermixed with this.  The heart is not enlarged.  The left axilla is intact in regards to adenopathy.  The inferior thyroid appears unremarkable.,Limited assessment of the upper abdomen discloses a region of lower density within the right hepatic lobe, this finding is indeterminate, and if there is need for additional imaging in regards to hepatic metastatic disease, follow up ultrasound.

 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Bronchoscopy & Lobectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carcinoma of the left upper lobe.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Bronchoscopy with aspiration.,2.  Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.  After reexamination, no bleeding was seen with three pericostal sutures of #1 chromic double strength.  A #2-0 Polydek was then used to close the chest wall muscle the anterior as well as latissimus dorsi #000 chromic subcutaneous tissue skin clips to the skin.  The chest tubes were attached to the Pleur-Evac drainage and placed on suction at this time.  The patient was extubated in the room without difficulty and sent to Recovery in satisfactory."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Selective Coronary Angiography & Angioplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND INDICATIONS:,  Acute non-ST-elevation MI.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS AND SUMMARY:,  The patient presented with an acute non-ST-elevation MI.  Despite medical therapy, she continued to have intermittent angina.  Angiography demonstrated the severe LAD as the culprit lesion.  This was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced.  She has residual lesions of 75% in the proximal right coronary and 60% proximal circumflex, and the other residual LAD lesions as noted above.  She will be continued on her medical therapy.  At age 90, she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Selective coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the cath lab, placed on the table in the supine position.  The area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  Using the percutaneous technique, a 6-French sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  With the guidewire in place, a 5-French JL-4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system.  The catheter was removed.  The sheath flushed.  The 5-French 3DRC catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery.  The cath removed, the sheath flushed.,It was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the LAD, which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the non-ST elevation-MI.  The patient was given a bolus of heparin and an ACT of approximately 50 seconds was obtained, we rebolused and the ACT was slightly lower.  We repeated the level and it was slightly higher.  We administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an ACT of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin IV.  Additionally, the patient had been given 300 mg of Plavix orally during the procedure and Integrilin IV bolus and then maintenance drip was started.,A 6-French CLS 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and HEW guidewire was positioned in the distal LAD and another HEW guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal.  An Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid LAD stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated.  Angiography was then performed, demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent.  The balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds, with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium.  The balloon was inflated and removed, repeat angiography performed.  We attempted to advance a Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but I could not advance it beyond the proximal LAD, where there was significant calcification.  The stent was removed.  Attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm Apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful.  It was removed, a new Apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal LAD and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed.  Repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection.  One more attempt was made to advance the Driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent, but again I could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal LAD and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal.  I felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90-year-old with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection, so the stent was removed.  The guidewires and guide cath were removed.  The sheath flushed and sutured into position.  The patient moved to ICU in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all.,CONTRAST: , Isovue-370, 120 mL.,FLUORO TIME: , 9.4 minutes.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 30 mL.,HEMODYNAMICS:,  Aorta 185/54.,Left ventriculography was not performed.  I did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve.,The left main is a large vessel, giving rise to LAD and circumflex vessels.  The left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,The LAD is a moderate-to-large vessel, giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderate-to-large third diagonal, and then a small fourth diagonal.  The LAD has significant calcification proximally.  There is a 50% stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent.  This resulted in a 30% residual, mostly eccentric calcified plaque.  Following this, there was a 50% stenosis in the LAD just after the takeoff of the third diagonal.  This was not ballooned.  Beyond this is an 80% stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99% stenosis after the fourth diagonal.  These 2 lesions were dilated with 10% residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25% residual distal to the fourth diagonal.  As noted above, this area was not stented because I could not safely advance the stent.  Note, there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the moderate-to-large third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty.,The circumflex is a large, nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches.  The proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60% stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal.  The remainder of the vessel was without significant disease.,The right coronary was a large, dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and small-to-moderate first posterolateral, small second posterolateral, and a small-to-moderate third posterolateral branch.  The right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75% stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch.  The remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease."
 Obstetrics / Gynecology, Pre-Eclampsia & Eclampsia ,"PRE-ECLAMPSIA, is a very serious condition unique to pregnancy in which blood pressure, the kidneys and the central nervous system are compromised.  It usually occurs from the 20th week of pregnancy to 7 days postpartum.  The cause is unknown.  It is also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension or toxemia of pregnancy.,ECLAMPSIA, is the end-stage of the pre-eclampsia process.  The vast majority of women who develop pre-eclampsia are pregnant with their first child and are towards the end of their child-bearing years.  There are identifiable risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia:  family history of pre-eclampsia, previous pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, multiple gestation, and a hydatiform mole (an intrauterine growth that mimics pregnancy).  A chronic high blood pressure and underlying blood vessel disease increases the risk.  Pre-eclampsia ranges from mild to severe to eclampsia as the end-stage.  Untreated pre-eclampsia can result in a stroke, fluid-build up around the lungs, kidney failure, death of baby and death of mother.,SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:,MILD PRE-ECLAMPSIA:,*  Significant blood pressure increase even if you are still within the normal blood pressure limits.,*  Swelling in the face, hands and feet which worsens in the a.m.,*  Gaining more than a pound a week, especially in the last trimester.,*  Routine prenatal checkup reveals protein in the urine.,*  Seizures are possible.,SEVERE PRE-ECLAMPSIA:,*  More blood pressure increase.,*  Further swelling in face, hands and feet.,*  Visual disturbances.,*  Headache.,*  Irritability.,*  Abdominal pain.,*  Tiredness.,*  Decreased urination.,*  Seizures possible.,*  Nausea and vomiting.,ECLAMPSIA:,*  Symptoms worsen.,*  Seizures.,*  Muscle twitches.,*  Coma.,TREATMENT:,*  Diagnosis - blood tests, urinalysis, blood pressure monitoring.,*  Mild preeclampsia can be treated at home.  Severe symptoms require hospitalization and possible early delivery of the baby, often by cesarean section.,*  Daily weighing.,*  Daily monitoring for protein in urine.,*  Medications to lower blood pressure if preeclampsia is severe.,*  Magnesium sulfate or other anti-seizure drugs may be necessary to prevent seizures.,*  Get lots of rest!

 Obstetrics / Gynecology, Pelvic Laparotomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Large left adnexal mass, 8 cm in diameter.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Pelvic adhesions, 6 cm ovarian cyst.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  ,1.  Pelvic laparotomy.,2.  Lysis of pelvic adhesions.,3.  Left salpingooophorectomy with insertion of Pain-Buster Pain Management System by Dr. X.,GROSS FINDINGS:  ,There was a transabdominal mass palpable in the lower left quadrant.  An ultrasound suggestive with a mass of 8 cm, did not respond to suppression with norethindrone acetate and on repeat ultrasound following the medical treatment, the ovarian neoplasm persisted and did not decreased in size.,PROCEDURE:  ,Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in lithotomy position, prepped and draped.  A low transverse incision was made down to and through to the rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was put laterally.  The inferior epigastric arteries were identified bilaterally, doubly clamped and tied with #0 Vicryl sutures.  The rectus muscle was then split transversally and the peritoneum was split transversally as well.  The left adnexal mass was identified and large bowel was attached to the mass and Dr. Zuba from General Surgery dissected the large bowel adhesions and separated them from the adnexal mass.  The ureter was then traced and found to be free of the mass and free of the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The infundibulopelvic ligament was isolated, entered via blunt dissection.  A #0 Vicryl suture was put into place, doubly clamped with curved Heaney clamps, cut with curved Mayo scissors and #0 Vicryl fixation suture put into place.  Curved Heaney clamps were then used to remove the remaining portion of the ovary from its attachment to the uterus and then #0 Vicryl suture was put into place.  Pathology was called to evaluate the mass for potential malignancy and the pathology's verbal report at the time of surgery was that this was a benign lesion.  Irrigation was used.  Minimal blood loss at the time of surgery was noted.  Sigmoid colon was inspected in place in physiologic position of the cul-de-sac as well as small bowel omentum.  Instrument, needle, and sponge counts were called for and found to be correct.  The peritoneum was closed with #0 Vicryl continuous running locking suture.  The rectus sheath was closed with #0 Vicryl continuous running locking suture.  A DonJoy Pain-Buster Pain Management System was placed through the skin into the subcutaneous space and the skin was closed with staples.  Final instrument needle counts were called for and found to be correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss and transferred to recovery area in satisfactory condition."

She was evaluated and scheduled for an elective procedure.,DESCRIPTION OF SURGERY:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthetic was administered.  Once appropriate anesthetic findings were achieved, the patient was intubated and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for a tonsillectomy.  He was placed in semi-Rose ___ position and a Crowe Davis-type mouth gag was introduced into the oropharynx.  Under an operating headlight, the oropharynx was clearly visualized.  The right tonsil was grasped with the fossa triangularis and using electrocautery enucleation technique, was removed from its fossa.  This followed placing the patient in a suspension position using a McIvor-type mouth gag and a red rubber Robinson catheter via the right naris.  Once the right tonsil was removed, the left tonsil was removed in a similar manner, once again using a needle point Bovie dissection at 20 watts.  With the tonsils removed, it was possible to visualize the adenoid pads.  The oropharynx was irrigated and the adenoid pad evaluated with an indirect mirror technique.  The adenoid pad was greater than 2+/4 and hypertrophic.  It was removed with successive passes of electrocautery suction.  The tonsillar fossa was then once again hemostased with suction cautery, injected with 0.5% ropivacaine with 1:100,000 adrenal solution and then closed with 2-0 Monocryl on an SH needle.  The redundant soft tissue of the uvula was removed posteriorly and cauterized with electrocautery to prevent swelling of the uvula in the postoperative period.  The patient's oropharynx and nasopharynx were irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline contained with small amount of iodine, and she was recovered from her general endotracheal anesthetic.  She was extubated and left the operating room in good condition to the postoperative recovery room area.,Estimated blood loss was minimal.  There were no complications.  Specimens produced were right and left tonsils.  The adenoid pad was ablated with electrocautery."

Repair of periumbilical hernia.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DISPOSITION: , The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.,SPECIMEN: , Hernia sac.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 98-year-old female who presents from nursing home extended care facility with an incarcerated umbilical hernia, intractable nausea and vomiting and a bowel obstruction.  Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.,PROCEDURE: , After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition."

 Hematology - Oncology, 3-Dimensional Simulation ,"3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION,This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures.  This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.,The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.,Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.,In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Right hyoid mass, rule out carcinomatosis.,2.  Weight loss.,3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,4.  Changes consistent with acute and chronic bronchitis.,5.  Severe mucosal irregularity with endobronchial narrowing of the right middle and lower lobes.,6.  Left vocal cord irregularity.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy with lavage, brushings, and endobronchial mucosal biopsies of the right bronchus intermedius/right lower lobe.,ANESTHESIA: , Demerol 50 mg with Versed 3 mg as well as topical cocaine and lidocaine solution.,LOCATION OF PROCEDURE: , Endoscopy suite #4.,After informed consent was obtained and following the review of the procedure including procedure as well as possible risks and complications were explained and consent was previously obtained, the patient was sedated with the above stated medication and the patient was continuously monitored on pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure, and EKG monitoring.  Prior to starting the procedure, the patient was noted to have a baseline oxygen saturation of 86% on room air.  Subsequently, she was given a bronchodilator treatment with Atrovent and albuterol and subsequent saturation increased to approximately 90% to 91% on room air.,The patient was placed on a supplemental oxygen as the patient was sedated with above-stated medication.  As this occurred, the bronchoscope was inserted into the right naris with good visualization of the nasopharynx and oropharynx.  The cords were noted to oppose bilaterally on phonation.  There was some slight mucosal irregularity noted on the vocal cord on the left side.  Additional topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords, at which point the bronchoscope was introduced into the trachea, which was midline in nature.  The bronchoscope was then advanced to the distal trachea and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this time, the bronchoscope was further advanced through the main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  Bronchoscope was then further advanced into the right upper lobe, which revealed no evidence of any endobronchial lesion.  The mucosa was diffusely friable throughout.  Bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn into the right main stem and additional lidocaine was instilled.  At this point, the bronchoscope was then advanced to the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, it was noted that there was severe mucosal irregularities of nodular in appearance significantly narrowing the right lower lobe and right middle lobe opening.  The mucosal area throughout this region was severely friable.  Additional lidocaine was instilled as well as topical epinephrine.  At this time, bronchoscope was maintained in this region and endobronchial biopsies were performed.  At the initial attempt of inserting biopsy forceps, some resistance was noted within the proximal channel at this time making advancement of the biopsy forceps out of the proximal channel impossible.  So the biopsy forceps was withdrawn and the bronchoscope was completely withdrawn and new bronchoscope was then utilized.  At this time, bronchoscope was then reinserted into the right naris and subsequently advanced to the vocal cords into the right bronchus intermedius without difficulty.  At this time, the biopsy forceps were easily passed and visualized in the right bronchus intermedius.  At this time, multiple mucosal biopsies were performed with some mild oozing noted.  Several aliquots of normal saline lavage followed.  After completion of multiple biopsies there was good hemostasis.  Cytology flushing was also performed in this region and subsequently several aliquots of additional normal saline lavage was followed.  Bronchoscope was unable to be passed distally to the base of the segment of the right lower lobe or distal to the further visualized endobronchial anatomy of the right middle lobe subsegments.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the distal trachea.,At this time, bronchoscope was then advanced to the left main stem.  Additional lidocaine was instilled.  The bronchoscope was advanced to the left upper and lower lobe subsegments.  There was no endobronchial lesion visualized.  There is mild diffuse erythema and fibromucosa was noted throughout.  No endobronchial lesion was visualized in the left bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then subsequently further withdrawn to the distal trachea and readvanced into the right bronchial system.  At this time, bronchoscope was readvanced into the right bronchus intermedius and additional aliquots of normal saline lavage until cleared.  There is no gross bleeding evidenced at this time or diffuse mucosal erythema and edema present throughout.  The bronchoscope was subsequently withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room.  During the bronchoscopy, the patient noted ________ have desaturation and required increasing FiO2 with subsequent increased saturation to 93% to 94%.  The patient remained at this level of saturation or greater throughout the remaining of the procedure.,The patient postprocedure relates having some intermittent hemoptysis prior to the procedure as well as moderate exertional dyspnea.  This was confirmed by her daughter and mother who were also present at the bedside postprocedure.  The patient did receive a nebulizer bronchodilator treatment immediately prebronchoscopy and postprocedure as well.  The patient also admitted to continued smoking in spite of all of the above.  The patient was extensively counseled regarding the continued smoking especially with her present symptoms.  She was advised regarding smoking cessation.  The patient was also placed on a prescription of prednisone 2 mg tablets starting at 40 mg a day decreasing every three days to continue to wean off.  The patient was also administered Solu-Medrol 60 mg IV x1 in recovery room.  There was no significant bronchospastic component noted, although because of the severity of the mucosal edema, erythema, and her complaints, short course of steroids will be instituted.  The patient was also advised to refrain from using any aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication because of her hemoptysis.  At this time, the patient was also advised that if hemoptysis were to continue or worsen or develop progressive dyspnea, to either contact myself, , or return to ABCD Emergency Room for evaluation of possible admission.  However, the above was reviewed with the patient in great detail as well as with her daughter and mother who were at the bedsite at this time as well."
 Hematology - Oncology, Glioblastoma Multiforme - Consult ,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION: , We were asked to see the patient in regards to a brain tumor.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,She was initially diagnosed in September of this year with a glioblastoma multiforme.  She presented with several lesions in her brain and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.  She was seen by Dr. X in our group.  Because of her living arrangement, she elected to have treatment through the hospital radiation department and oncology department.  Details of her treatment are not available at the time of this dictation.  Her family has a packet of Temodar 100-mg pills.  She is admitted now with increasing confusion.  A CT shows increase in size of the lesions compared to the preoperative scan.  We are asked to comment on her treatment at this point.  She herself is confused and is unable to provide further history.  ,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , From her old chart:  No known past medical history prior to the diagnosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,She was living alone and is now living in assisted living.  ,MEDICATIONS,1.  Dilantin 300 mg daily.,2.  Haloperidol 1 mg h.s.,3.  Dexamethasone 4 mg q.i.d. ,4.  Docusate 100 mg b.i.d.,5.  Pen-VK 500 mg daily.,6.  Ibuprofen 600 mg daily.,7.  Zantac 150 mg twice a day.,8.

Ears and nose normal.  Mouth normal.,NECK:  Supple.,CHEST: Clear.,HEART:  Normal.,ABDOMEN: Soft, positive bowel sounds.,NEUROLOGIC:  Alert, cranial nerves intact.  Left arm slightly weak.  Left leg slightly weak.,IMPRESSION AND PLAN:,  Glioblastoma multiforme, uncertain as to where she is in cancer treatment.  Given the number of pills in the patient's family's hands, it sounds like she has only been treated recently and therefore it is not surprising that she is showing increased problems related to increased size of the tumor.  We will have to talk with Dr. Y in the Clinic to get a better handle on her treatment regimen.  At this point, I will hold Temodar today and consider restarting it tomorrow if we can get her treatment plan clarified."
 Orthopedic, Symes Amputation - Hallux ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Mass, left second toe.,2.  Tumor.,3.  Left hallux bone invasion of the distal phalanx.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Mass, left second toe.,2.  Tumor.,3.  Left hallux with bone invasion of the distal phalanx.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Excision of mass, left second toe.,2.  Distal Syme's amputation, left hallux with excisional biopsy.,HISTORY: , This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot.  The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.,The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.,Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC."
 Gastroenterology, ERCP ,"PROCEDURE:, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:, Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.,MEDICATIONS:, General anesthesia.,The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: ,After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.,FINDINGS:,1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.,2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.,3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1. NPO except ice chips today.,2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.,3. Follow up biopsies and cytology."
 Urology, Scrotal Exploration ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left testicular torsion, possibly detorsion.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Left testicular torsion, possibly detorsion.,PROCEDURE: , Left scrotal exploration with detorsion.  Already, de-torsed bilateral testes fixation and bilateral appendix testes cautery.,ANESTHETIC:,  A 0.25% Marcaine local wound insufflation per surgeon, 15 mL of Toradol.,FINDINGS:,  Congestion in the left testis and cord with a bell-clapper deformity on the right small appendix testes bilaterally.  No testis necrosis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  5 mL.,FLUIDS RECEIVED: , 300 mL of crystalloid.,TUBES AND DRAINS:,  None.,SPECIMENS: , No tissues sent to pathology.,COUNTS:,  Sponges and needle counts were correct x2.,INDICATIONS OF OPERATION: , The patient is a 4-year-old boy with abrupt onset of left testicular pain.  He has had a history of similar onset.  Apparently, he had no full on one ultrasound and full on a second ultrasound, but because of possible torsion, detorsion, or incomplete detorsion, I recommended an exploration.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:,  The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification was verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was placed in supine position and sterilely prepped and draped.  Superior scrotal incisions were then made with 15-blade knife and further extended up to the subcutaneous tissue and dartos fascia with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  The subdartos pouch was created with curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was then delivered, incised, and testis was delivered.  The testis itself with a bell-clapper deformity.  There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord.  The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created.  The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation.  No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used.  The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  Again, an appendix testis was cauterized.  No torsion was seen.  He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture.  The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine.  The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was given IV Toradol and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
 Orthopedic, Rotator Cuff Tear ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy.  I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks."
 Orthopedic, Carpal Tunnel Release - 5 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral.,ANESTHESIA:,  General,NAME OF OPERATION: , Bilateral open carpal tunnel release.,FINDINGS AT OPERATION: , The patient had identical, very thick, transverse carpal ligaments, with dull synovium.,PROCEDURE:  ,Under satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine manner on both upper extremities.  The right upper extremity was exsanguinated, and the tourniquet inflated.  A curved incision was made at the the ulnar base, carried through the subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia, down to the transverse carpal ligament.  This was divided under direct vision along its ulnar border, and wound closed with interrupted nylon.  The wound was injected, and a dry, sterile dressing was applied.  An identical procedure was done to the opposite side.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition."

 Orthopedic, Achilles Lengthening ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Idiopathic toe walker.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Idiopathic toe walker.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral open Achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking cast.,ANESTHESIA: , Surgery performed under general anesthesia.  A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,No intraoperative complications.,DRAINS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,TOURNIQUET TIME:  ,On the left side was 30 minutes, on the right was 21 minutes.,HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:,  The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year.  The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally.  He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk.  Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family.  Family however wanted to correct his toe walking.  Surgery was then discussed.  Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems.  All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table  General anesthesia was then administered.  The patient received Ancef preoperatively.  The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded.  Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh.  Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion.  We turned our attention first towards the left side.  A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin.  The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg.  Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath.  Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut.  Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked.  This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture.  This was also oversewn.  Wound was then irrigated.  Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine.  It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril.  Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes.  The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes.  While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition.,POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:  ,The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery.  He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks.  He is to follow up in approximately 10 days for recheck as well as prescription for intended AFOs, which he will need up to 6 months.  The patient may or may not need physical therapy while his Achilles lengthenings are healing.  The patient is not to participate in any PE for at least 6 months.  The patient is given Tylenol No. 3 for pain."
 Nephrology, Renal Transplant - Cadaveric ,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 50-year-old African American female with past medical history significant for hypertension and endstage renal disease, on hemodialysis secondary to endstage renal disease, last hemodialysis was on June 22, 2007.  The patient presents with no complaints for cadaveric renal transplant.  After appropriate cross match and workup of HLA typing of both recipient and cadaveric kidneys, the patient was deemed appropriate for operative intervention and transplantation of kidney.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Endstage renal disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Endstage renal disease.,PROCEDURE:,  Cadaveric renal transplant to right pelvis.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 400 mL.,FLUIDS:  ,One liter of normal saline and one liter of 5% of albumin.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,SPECIMEN:  ,None.,DRAIN: , None.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,The patient tolerated the procedure without any complication.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  After adequate anesthesia was achieved, a curvilinear incision was made in the right pelvic fossa approximately 9 cm in length extending from the 1.5 cm medial of the ASIS down to the suprapubic space.  After this was taken down with a #10 blade, electrocautery was used to take down tissue down to the layer of the subcutaneous fat.  Camper's and Scarpa's were dissected with electrocautery.  Hemostasis was achieved throughout the tissue plains with electrocautery.  The external oblique aponeurosis was identified with musculature and was entered with electrocautery.  Then hemostats were entered in and dissection continued down with electrocautery down through the external internal obliques and the transversalis fascia.  Additionally, the rectus sheath was entered in a linear fashion.  After these planes were entered using electrocautery, the retroperitoneum was dissected free from the transversalis fascia using blunt dissection.  After the peritoneum and peritoneal structures were moved medially and superiorly by blunt dissection, the dissection continued down bluntly throughout the tissue planes removing some alveolar tissue over the right iliac artery.  Upon entering through the transversalis fascia, the epigastric vessels were identified and doubly ligated and tied with #0 silk ties.  After the ligation of the epigastric vessels, the peritoneum was bluntly dissected and all peritoneal structures were bluntly dissected to a superior and medial plane.  This was done without any complication and without entering the peritoneum grossly.  The round ligament was identified and doubly ligated at this time with #0 silk ties as well.  The dissection continued down now to layer of the alveolar tissue covering the right iliac artery.  This alveolar tissue was cleared using blunt dissection as well as electrocautery.  After the external iliac artery was identified, it was cleared circumferentially all the way around and noted to have good flow and had good arterial texture.  The right iliac vein was then identified, and this was cleared again using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  After the right iliac vein was identified and cleared off all the alveolar tissue, it was circumferentially cleared as well.  An additional perforating branch was noted at the inferior pole of the right iliac vein.  This was tied with a #0 silk tie and secured.  Hemostasis was achieved at this time and the tie had adequate control.  The dissection continued down and identified all other vital structures in this area.  Careful preservation of all vital structures was carried out throughout the dissection.  At this time, Satinsky clamp was placed over the right iliac vein.  This was then opened using a #11 blade, approximately 1 cm in length.  The heparinized saline was placed and irrigated throughout the inside of the vein, and the kidney was pulled into the abdominal field still covered in its protective socking with the superior pole marked.  The renal vein was then elevated and identified in this area.  A 5-0 double-ended Prolene stitch was used to secure the renal vein, both superiorly and inferiorly, and after appropriately being secured with 5-0 Prolene, these were tied down and secured.  The renal vein was then anastomosed to the right iliac vein in a circumferential manner in a running fashion until secured at both superior and inferior poles.  The dissection then continued down and the iliac artery was then anastomosed to the renal artery at this time using a similar method with 5-0 Prolene securing both superior and inferior poles.  After such time the 5-0 Prolene was run around in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  After this was done and the artery was secured, the Satinsky clamp was removed and a bulldog placed over.  The flow was then opened on the arterial side and then opened on the venous side to allow for proper flow.  The bulldog was then placed back on the renal vein and allowed for the hyperperfusion of the kidney.  The kidney pinked up nicely and had a good appearance to it and had appearance of good blood flow.  At this time, all Satinsky clamps were removed and all bulldog clamps were removed.  The dissection then continued down to the layer of the bladder at which time the bladder was identified.  Appropriate area on the dome the bladder was identified for entry.  This was entered using electrocautery and approximately 1 cm length after appropriately sizing and incising of the ureter using the Metzenbaum scissors in a linear fashion.  Before this was done, #0 chromic catgut stitches were placed and secured laterally and inferiorly on the dome of the bladder to elevate the area of the bladder and then the bladder was entered using the electrocautery approximately 1 cm in length.  At this time, a renal stent was placed into the ureter and secured superiorly and the stent was then placed into the bladder and secured as well.  Subsequently, the superior and inferior pole stitches with 5-0 Prolene were used to secure the ureter to the bladder.  This was then run mucosa-to-mucosa in a circumferential manner until secured in both superior and inferior poles once again.  Good flow was noted from the ureter at the time of operation.  Additional Vicryl stitches were used to overlay the musculature in a seromuscular stitch over the dome of the bladder and over the ureter itself.  At this time, an Ethibond stitch was used to make an additional seromuscular closure and rolling of the bladder musculature over the dome and over the anastomosis once again.  This was inspected and noted for proper control.  Irrigation of the bladder revealed that the bladder was appropriately filled and there were no flows and no defects.  At this time, the anastomoses were all inspected, hemostasis was achieved and good closure of the anastomosis was noted at this time.  The kidney was then placed back into its new position in the right pelvic fossa, and the area was once again inspected for hemostasis which was achieved.  A 1-0 Prolene stitch was then used for mass closure of the external, internal, and transversalis fascias and musculature in a running fashion from superior to inferior.  This was secured and knots were dumped.  Subsequently, the area was then checked and inspected for hemostasis which was achieved with electrocautery, and the skin was closed with 4-0 running Monocryl.  The patient tolerated procedure well without evidence of complication, transferred to the Dunn ICU where he was noted to be stable.  Dr. A was present and scrubbed through the entire procedure."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Tilt Table Test - 1 ,"INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 22-year-old female with past medical history of syncope.  The patient is also complaining of dizziness.  She was referred here by Dr. X for tilt table.,TECHNIQUE: , Risks and benefits explained to the patient.  Consent obtained.  She was lying down on her back for 20 minutes and her blood pressure was 111/75 and heart rate 89.  She was standing up on the tilt tablet for 20 minutes and her heart rate went up to 127 and blood pressure was still in 120/80.  Then, the patient received sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg.  The patient felt dizzy at that time and heart rate was in the 120 and blood pressure was 110/50.  The patient felt nauseous and felt hot at that time.  She did not pass out.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,Tilt table was then terminated.,SUMMARY:,  Positive tilt table for vasovagal syncope with significant increase of heart rate with minimal decrease of blood pressure.,RECOMMENDATIONS: , I recommend followup in the office in one week and she will need Toprol-XL 12.5 mg every day if symptoms persist."
 ENT - Otolaryngology, Tonsillectomy and Septoplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with hypertrophy of tonsils and of uvula and soft palate with deviation of nasal septum.,OPERATION:,  Tonsillectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, and septoplasty.,ANESTHESIA:,  General anesthetics.,HISTORY: , This is a 51-year-old gentleman here with his wife.  She confirms the history of loud snoring at night with witnessed apnea.  The result of the sleep study was reviewed.  This showed moderate sleep apnea with significant desaturation.  The patient was unable to tolerate treatment with CPAP.  At the office, we observed large tonsils and elongation and thickening of the uvula as well as redundant soft tissue of the palate.  A tortuous appearance of the septum also was observed.  This morning, I talked to the patient and his wife about the findings.  I reviewed the CT images.  He has no history of sinus infections and does not recall a history of nasal trauma.  We discussed the removal of tonsils and uvula and soft palate tissue and the hope that this would help with his airway.  Depending on the findings of surgery, I explained that I might remove that bone spur that we are seeing within the nasal passage.  I will get the best look at it when he is asleep.  We discussed recovery as well.  He visited with Dr. XYZ about the anesthetic produce.,PROCEDURE:,:  General tracheal anesthetic was administered by Dr. XYZ and Mr. Radke.  Afrin drops were placed in both nostrils and a cottonoid soaked with Afrin was placed in each side of the nose.  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag was placed.  The tonsils were very large and touched the uvula.  The uvula was relatively long and very thick and there were redundant folds of soft palate mucosa and prominent posterior and anterior tonsillar pillars.  Also, there was a cryptic appearance of the tonsils but there was no acute redness or exudate.  Retraction of the soft palate permitted evaluation of the nasopharynx with the mirror and the choanae were patent and there was no adenoid tissue present.  A very crowded pharynx was appreciated.  The tonsils were first removed using electrodissection technique.  Hemostasis was achieved with the electrocautery and with sutures of 0 plain catgut.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  There already was more room in the pharynx, but the posterior pharyngeal wall was still obscured by the soft palate and uvula.  The uvula was grasped with the Alice clamp.  I palpated the posterior edge of the hard palate and calculated removal of about a third of the length of the soft palate.  We switched over from the Bayonet cautery to the blunt needle tip electrocautery.  The planned anterior soft palate incision was marked out with the electrocautery from the left anterior tonsillar pillar rising upwards and then extending horizontally across the soft palate to include all of the uvula and a portion of the soft palate, and the incision then extended across the midline and then inferiorly to meet the right anterior tonsillar pillar.  This incision was then deepened with the electrocautery on a cutting current.  The uvular artery just to the right of the midline was controlled with the suction electrocautery.  The posterior soft palate incision was made parallel to the anterior soft palate incision but was made leaving a longer length of mucosa to permit closure of the palatoplasty.  A portion of the redundant soft palate mucosa tissue also was included with the resection specimen and the tissue including the soft palate and uvula was included with the surgical specimen as the tonsils were sent to pathology.  The tonsil fossae were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The soft palate was also injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine.  The posterior tonsillar pillars were then brought forward to close to the anterior tonsillar pillars and these were sutured down to the tonsil bed with interrupted 0 plain catgut sutures.  The posterior soft palate mucosa was advanced forward and brought up to the anterior soft palate incision and closure of the soft palate wound was then accomplished with interrupted 3-0 chromic catgut sutures.  A much improved appearance of the oropharynx with a greatly improved airway was appreciated.  A moist tonsil sponge was placed into the nasopharynx and the mouth gag was removed.  I removed the cottonoids from both nostrils.  Speculum exam showed the inferior turbinates were large, the septum was tortuous and it angulated to the right and then sharply bent back to the left.  The septum was injected with 0.25% Marcaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine using a separate syringe and needle.  A #15 blade was used to make a left cheilion incision.,Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum were elevated with the Cottle elevator.  When we reached the deflected portion of the vomer, this was separated from the septal cartilage with a Freer elevator.  The right-sided mucoperiosteum was elevated with the Freer elevator and then with Takahashi forceps and with the 4 mm osteotome, the deflected portion of the septal bone from the vomer was resected.  This tissue also was sent as a separate specimen to pathology.  The intraseptal space was irrigated with saline and suctioned.  The nasal septal mucosal flaps were then sutured together with a quilting suture of 4-0 plain catgut.  I observed no evidence of purulent secretion or polyp formation within the nostrils.  The inferior turbinates were then both outfractured using a knife handle, and now there was a much more patent nasal airway on both sides.  There was good support for the nasal tip and the dorsum and there was good hemostasis within the nose.  No packing was used in the nostrils.  Polysporin ointment was introduced into both nostrils.  The mouth gag was reintroduced and the pack removed from the nasopharynx.  The nose and throat were irrigated with saline and suctioned.  An orogastric tube was placed and a moderate amount of clear fluid suctioned from the stomach and this tube was removed.  Sponge and needle count were reported correct.  The mouth gag having been withdrawn, the patient was then awakened and returned to recovery room in a satisfactory condition.  He tolerated the operation excellently.  Estimated blood loss was about 15-20 cc.  In the recovery room, I observed that he was moving air well and I spoke with his wife about the findings of surgery."

 Gastroenterology, Barium Swallow Study Evaluation - 1 ,"HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 76-year-old male, with previous history of dysphagia, status post stroke.  The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.,STUDY: , Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.,To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).,FINDINGS,ORAL STAGE: , The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.,The patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.,PHARYNGEAL STAGE: , Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.,CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: , The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.,PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: , With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.,PLAN:,Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended:,1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.,2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.,3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.,4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.,Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety."
 Neurology, Lumbar Puncture - 1 ,"PROCEDURE: , Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation.,INDICATION: , The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test.  She was transfused with packed red blood cells.  Her hemolysis seemed to slow down.  She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen.  Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital.  She had a blood culture, which was also negative.  She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously.  Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics.  After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present.  She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI.,I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures.  The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression.  Questions were answered to their satisfaction.  They would like to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After ""time out"" procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained.  She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself.  She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied.  She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision.  Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact.  The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained.  The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied.  Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back.,During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable.  Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back.,Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose.,DISPOSITION: , The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition."

He has been admitted to the hospital now for colonoscopy and polyp surveillance.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was prepped and draped in a left lateral decubitus position.  The flexible 165 cm CF video Olympus colonoscope was inserted through the anus and passed under TV-directed monitor through the area of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and cecum.  He had an excellent prep.  He had a 2-3 mm polyp in the left colon that was removed with a jumbo biopsy forceps.  He tolerated the procedure well.  There was no other evidence of any cancer, growth, tumor, colitis, or problems throughout the entire colon.  His exam that he had in 1997 showed a small amount of colitis at that time and he has had some intermittent symptoms since.  Representative pictures were taken throughout the entire exam.  There was no other evidence any problems.  On withdrawal of the scope, the same findings were noted.,FINAL IMPRESSION: , Small, left colon polyp in a patient with intermittent colitis-like symptoms and bleeding."

Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes.,4.  Right thoracotomy.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.,Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition."

He has moderately good abduction of all fingers.  He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb.  He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength.,We did an x-ray of his elbow.  He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length.  The proximal part looks like it is in good position.  The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement.  There is no significant angulation.  The joint itself appears to be intact.  The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint.  I do not see any extra blood in the joint.  I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign.,I spoke with Dr. X.  He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up.  At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision.  The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time.,Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow.,He had much better comfort once this was applied.  There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort.,Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass.,We then gave him a sling.,We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go.  Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime.,I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with.  They were warned to come back here if he has increasing neurologic deficits in his hands or any new problems.,DIAGNOSES:,1.  Fracture of the humerus, spiral.,2.  Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia.,3.  Psychiatric disorder, unspecified.,DISPOSITION:  The patient will follow up as mentioned above.

 Nephrology, AV Fistula - 3 ,"TITLE OF PROCEDURE,Creation of AV fistula, left wrist in the anatomic snuffbox.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS,End-stage renal disease, need for chronic access.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS,End-stage renal disease, need for chronic access.,INDICATION OF THE PROCEDURE,This 74-year-old lady was referred by Dr. P for placement of an AV fistula.  She has been on dialysis since December 2006 by a PermCath placed in her right internal jugular vein.  She undergoes dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at DaVita in Alameda and is under the care of Dr. P.  She underwent coronary bypass surgery in 2000 and her cardiologist is Dr. T.  She lives with her husband and she also has a son at home and she is a very active lady.  She is right handed.  The plan was to place an AV fistula at the left wrist.  The risks and benefits were fully explained to her.  She elected to proceed as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,In the operating room, under monitored anesthesia care with intravenous sedation, she was prepped and draped surgically.  Lidocaine 1% was used for local anesthesia in the anatomic snuffbox at the left wrist.  The cephalic vein was exposed.  The superficial branch of the radial artery was carefully protected and the radial artery was exposed.  There was moderate calcification of the radial artery.,The patient was heparinized and end-to-side anastomosis was performed between the cephalic vein and radial artery using a 7-0 Prolene suture.  There was an excellent Doppler signal in the cephalic vein all the way up the arm upon completion.,The wound was closed using absorbable suture and she was transferred to Recovery.  There were no complications."
 ENT - Otolaryngology, Adenotonsillectomy - 2 ,"POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy.,OPERATION PERFORMED:  Adenotonsillectomy.,ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.,INDICATIONS:  The patient is a very nice patient with adenotonsillitis with hypertrophy and obstructive symptoms.  Adenotonsillectomy is indicated.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, table was turned and shoulder roll was placed on the shoulders and face was draped in clean fashion.  A McIvor mouth gag was applied.  The tongue was retracted anteriorly and the McIvor was gently suspended from a Mayo stand.  A red rubber Robinson catheter was inserted through the left naris and the soft palate was retracted superiorly.  The adenoids were removed with suction electrocautery under mere visualization.  The left tonsil was grasped with a curved Allis forceps, retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion.  The right tonsil was grasped in the similar fashion and retracted medially and the anterior tonsillar pillar was incised with Bovie electrocautery.  The tonsil was removed from the superior pole and inferior pole using Bovie electrocautery in its entirety in the subcapsular fashion.  The inferior, middle and superior pole vessels were further cauterized with suction electrocautery.  Copious saline irrigation of the oral cavity was then performed.  There was no further identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  The estimated blood loss was less than 10 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications."
 Urology, Prostatectomy - Nerve Sparing ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Prostate cancer.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Prostate cancer.,OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , 450 mL.,REPLACEMENT:,  250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: , This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate.  Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
 Gastroenterology, CT Abdomen & Pelvis ,"EXAM:,  CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast, ,REASON FOR EXAM: , Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. , ,TECHNIQUE: , 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement.  No oral or rectal contrast was utilized.  Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05.  There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.  Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips.  The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen.  There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak.  Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either.  No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present.  The findings are unchanged from the prior exam.  ,The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present.  There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney.  No hydronephrosis is present.  No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. ,The lung bases are clear. ,Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.  There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement.  There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  The bladder grossly appears normal.  A hysterectomy has been performed.  ,IMPRESSION:,1.  No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described.  The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04.  ,2.  Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level.  ,3.  No other acute findings noted. ,4.  Advanced left renal atrophy."
 Neurology, MRI T-L Spine - Schistosomiasis ,"CC: ,Paraplegia.,HX:, This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time.,On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb.,She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with ""pins & needles"" sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g.,On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal<1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued.,On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively.

Clots partially obstructing the endotracheal tube and completely obstructing the entire left main stem and entire left bronchial system.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: ,Emergent fiberoptic plus bronchoscopy with lavage.,LOCATION OF PROCEDURE:  ,ICU.  Room #164.,ANESTHESIA/SEDATION:,  Propofol drip, Brevital 75 mg, morphine 5 mg, and Versed 8 mg.,HISTORY,:  The patient is a 44-year-old male who was admitted to ABCD Hospital on 09/04/03 status post MVA with multiple trauma and subsequently diagnosed with multiple spine fractures as well as bilateral pulmonary contusions, requiring ventilatory assistance.  The patient was noted with acute respiratory distress on ventilator support with both ventilator asynchrony and progressive desaturation.  Chest x-ray as noted above revealed complete atelectasis of the left lung.  The patient was subsequently sedated and received one dose of paralytic as noted above followed by emergent fiberoptic flexible bronchoscopy.,PROCEDURE DETAIL,:  A bronchoscope was inserted through the oroendotracheal tube, which was partially obstructed with blood clots.  These were lavaged with several aliquots of normal saline until cleared.  The bronchoscope required removal because the tissue/clots were obstructing the bronchoscope.  The bronchoscope was reinserted on several occasions until cleared and advanced to the main carina.  The endotracheal tube was noted to be in good position.  The bronchoscope was advanced through the distal trachea.  There was a white tissue completely obstructing the left main stem at the carina.  The bronchoscope was advanced to this region and several aliquots of normal saline lavage were instilled and suctioned.  Again this partially obstructed the bronchoscope requiring several times removing the bronchoscope to clear the lumen.  The bronchoscope subsequently was advanced into the left mainstem and subsequently left upper and lower lobes.  There was diffuse mucus impactions/tissue as well as intermittent clots.  There was no evidence of any active bleeding noted.  Bronchoscope was adjusted and the left lung lavaged until no evidence of any endobronchial obstruction is noted.  Bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and advanced into the right bronchial system.  There is no plugging or obstruction of the right bronchial system.  The bronchoscope was then withdrawn to the main carina and slowly withdrawn as the position of endotracheal tube was verified, approximately 4 cm above the main carina.  The bronchoscope was then completely withdrawn as the patient was maintained on ventilator support during and postprocedure.  Throughout the procedure, pulse oximetry was greater than 95% throughout.  There is no hemodynamic instability or variability noted during the procedure.  Postprocedure chest x-ray is pending at this time."

The patient was started on alpha-blockers with some help, but had nocturia q.1h.  The patient was given anticholinergics with minimal to no help.  The patient had a cystoscopy done, which showed enlargement of the left lateral lobes of the prostate.  At this point, options were discussed such as watchful waiting and laser vaporization to open up the prostate to get a better stream.  Continuation of alpha-blockers and adding another anti-cholinergic at night to prevent bladder overactivity were discussed.  The patient was told that his symptoms may be related to the mild-to-moderate trabeculation in the bladder, which can cause poor compliance.,The patient understood and wanted to proceed with laser vaporization to see if it would help improve his stream, which in turn might help improve emptying of the bladder and might help his overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was told that he may need anticholinergics.  There could be increased risk of incontinence, stricture, erectile dysfunction, other complications and the consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given preoperative antibiotics.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #23-French scope was inserted inside the urethra into the bladder under direct vision.  Bilateral pyelograms were normal.  The rest of the bladder appeared normal except for some moderate trabeculations throughout the bladder.  There was enlargement of the lateral lobes of the prostate.  The old TUR scar was visualized right at the bladder neck.  Using diode side-firing fiber, the lateral lobes were taken down.  The verumontanum, the external sphincter, and the ureteral openings were all intact at the end of the procedure.  Pictures were taken and were shown to the family.  At the end of the procedure, there was good hemostasis.  A total of about 15 to 20 minutes of lasering time was used.  A #22 3-way catheter was placed.  At the end of the procedure, the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition.  Plan was for removal of the Foley catheter in 48 hours and continuation of use of anticholinergics at night."

 Orthopedic, Osteotomy & Bunionectomy - 1 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Plantar flex third metatarsal, right foot.,2.  Talus bunion, right foot.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Plantar flex third metatarsal, right foot.,2.  Talus bunion, right foot.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Third metatarsal osteotomy, right foot.,2.  Talus bunionectomy, right foot.,3.  Application of short-leg cast, right foot.,ANESTHESIA: , TIVA/local.,HISTORY:  ,This 31-year-old female presents to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on her painful right third plantar flex metatarsal.  In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot.  She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart.  She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction.  Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied.,Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion.  An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg.  Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area.  There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head.  A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring.  Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length.  Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen.  Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue.  Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue.  Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified.  A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal.  McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed.  A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered.  The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound.  Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw.  The metatarsal head was allowed to float.  The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained.  Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.,Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal.  There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively.  A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue.  Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined.  The abductor tendon was identified and retracted.  A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone.  The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade.,Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline.  #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues.  #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture.  Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique.  Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head.  A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head.  The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa.  The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied.,Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences.  3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast.  One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast.  The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot.  She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot.  She was counseled on smoking cessation.  She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain.  She was given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d.  She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday.  She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot.  She was given emergency contact numbers to call us if problem arises."

He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics."
 Neurosurgery, Ulnar Nerve Transposition ,"PROCEDURE:,  Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion.  The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg.,A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve.  Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve.  Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected.,Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized.  Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly.,The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed.  Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery.  The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass.  Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve.,A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures.  Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound.  The elbow was dressed and splinted.  The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
 ENT - Otolaryngology, Cauterization - Epistaxis ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Epistaxis and chronic dysphonia.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Atrophic dry nasal mucosa.,2.  Epistaxis.,3.  Atrophic laryngeal changes secondary to inhaled steroid use.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Cauterization of epistaxis, left nasal septum.,2.  Fiberoptic nasal laryngoscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , Neo-Synephrine with lidocaine nasal spray.,FINDINGS:,1.  Atrophic dry cracked nasal mucosa.,2.  Atrophic supraglottic and glottic changes likely secondary to inhaled steroids and recent endotracheal tube intubation.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 37-year-old African-American female who was admitted to ABCD General Hospital with a left wrist abscess.  The patient was taken to the operating room for incision and drainage.  Postoperatively, the patient was placed on nasal cannula oxygen and developed subsequent epistaxis.  Upon evaluating the patient, the patient complains of epistaxis from the left naris as well as some chronic dysphonia that had become exacerbated after surgery.  The patient does report of having endotracheal tube intubation during anesthesia.  The patient also gives a history of inhaled steroid use for her asthma.,The patient was extubated after surgery without difficulty, but continued to have some difficulty and the Department of Otolaryngology was asked to evaluate the patient regarding epistaxis and dysphonia.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  After the procedure was described, the patient was placed in the seated position.  The fiberoptic nasal laryngoscope was then inserted into the patient's left naris.  The nasal mucosal membranes were dry and atrophic throughout.  There was no evidence of any mass lesions.  The nasal laryngoscope was then advanced towards the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, lesion, or obstruction.  The nasolaryngoscopy continued to be advanced into the oropharynx and the vallecula and the base of the tongue were evaluated and were without evidence of mass lesion or ulceration.,The fiberoptic scope was further advanced and visualization of the larynx revealed some atrophic, dry, supraglottic, and glottic changes.  There was no evidence of any local mass lesion, nodule, or ulcerations.  There was no evidence of any erythema.  Upon phonation, the vocal cords approximated completely and upon inspiration, the true vocal cords were abducted in a normal fashion and was symmetric.  The airway was stable and patent throughout the entire examination.  The nasal laryngoscope was then slowly withdrawn from the supraglottic region and the scope was further advanced into the oropharynx and nasopharynx.  The eustachian tube was completely visualized and was patent without obstruction.  The scope was then further removed without difficulty.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and remained in stable condition.,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , The patient would benefit from Ocean nasal spray as well as bacitracin ointment applied to the anterior naris.  At this time, we were unable to discontinue the patient's inhaled steroids that she is using for her asthma.  If this becomes possible in the future, this may provide her some relief of her chronic dysphonia.  The patient is to follow up with Department of Otolaryngology after discharge from the hospital for further evaluation of these problems."
 Ophthalmology, Phacoemulsification & Lens Implantation - 6 ,"PROCEDURE: , Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens insertion.,INTRAOCULAR LENS: , Allergan Medical Optics model S140MB XXX diopter chamber lens.,PHACO TIME:,  Not known.,ANESTHESIA: , Retrobulbar block with local minimal anesthesia care.,COMPLICATIONS:  ,None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , While the patient was in the holding area, the operative eye was dilated with four sets of drops.  The drops consisted of Cyclogyl 1%, Acular, and Neo-Synephrine 2.5 %.  Additionally, a peripheral IV was established by the anesthesia team.  Once the eye was dilated, the patient was wheeled to the operating suite.,Inside the operating suite, central monitoring lines were established.  Through the peripheral IV, the patient received intravenous sedation consisting of Propofol and once somnolent from this, retrobulbar block was administered consisting of 2 cc's of 2% Xylocaine  plain with 150 units of Wydase.  The block was administered in a retrobulbar fashion using an Atkinson needle and a good block was obtained.  Digital pressure was applied for approximately five minutes.,The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for ophthalmological surgery.  A Betadine prep was carried out of the face, lids, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A wire lid speculum was inserted to maintain patency of the lids.  With benefit of the operating microscope, a diamond blade was used to place a groove temporally.  A paracentesis wound was also placed temporally using the same blade.  Viscoelastic was then instilled into the anterior chamber through the paracentesis site and a 2.8 mm. diamond keratome was used to enter the anterior chamber through the previously placed groove.  The cystotome was then inserted into the eye and circular capsulorhexis was performed without difficulty.  The capsular remnant was withdrawn from the eye using long angled McPherson forceps.  Balanced salt solution with a blunt cannula was then inserted into the eye and hydrodissection was performed.  The lens was noted to rotate freely within the capsular bag.  The phaco instrument was then inserted into the eye using the Kelman tip.  The lens nucleus was grooved and broken into two halves.  One of the halves was in turn broken into quarters.  Each of the quarters was removed from the eye using the memory 2 settings and phacoemulsification.  Attention was then turned toward the remaining half of the nucleus and this, in turn, was removed as well, with the splitting maneuver.  Once the nucleus had been removed from the eye, the irrigating and aspirating tip was inserted and the cortical material was stripped out in sections.  Once the cortical material had been completely removed, a diamond dusted cannula was inserted into the eye and the posterior capsule was polished.  Viscoelastic was again instilled into the capsular bag as well as the anterior chamber.  The wound was enlarged slightly using the diamond keratome.  The above described intraocular lens was folded outside the eye using a mustache fold and inserted using folding forceps.  Once inside the eye, the lens was unfolded into the capsular bag in a single maneuver.  It was noted to be centered nicely.  The viscoelastic was then withdrawn from the eye using the irrigating and aspirating tip of the phaco machine.,Next, Miostat was instilled into the operative eye and the wound was checked for water tightness.  It was found to be such.  After removing the drapes and speculum, TobraDex drops were instilled into the operative eye and a gauze patch and Fox protective shield were placed over the eye.,The patient tolerated the procedure extremely well and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.  The patient is scheduled to be seen in follow-up in the office tomorrow, but should any complications arise this evening, the patient is to contact me immediately."

The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic.  Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam.  There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele.  On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each.  The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure.  The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics.  Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed.  The patient was interested in the trial.  The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.,Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.  Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution.  The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.,The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition."
 Ophthalmology, Vitrectomy - 1 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment, right eye.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment, right eye.,NAME OF PROCEDURE: , Combined closed vitrectomy with membrane peeling, fluid-air exchange, and endolaser, right eye.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with standby.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room, and an equal mixture of Marcaine 0.5% and lidocaine 2% was injected in a retrobulbar fashion.  As soon as satisfactory anesthesia and akinesia had been achieved, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual manner for sterile ophthalmic surgery.  A wire lid speculum was inserted.  Three modified sclerotomies were selected at 9, 10, and 1 o'clock.  At the 9 o'clock position, the Accurus infusion line was put in place and tied with a preplaced #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The two superior sites at 10 and 1 were opened up where the operating microscope with the optical illuminating system was brought into position, and closed vitrectomy was begun.  Initially formed core vitrectomy was performed and formed anterior vitreous was removed.  After this was completed, attention was placed in the posterior segment.  Several broad areas of vitreoretinal traction were noted over the posterior pole out of the equator where the previously noted retinal tears were noted.  These were carefully lifted and dissected off the edges of the flap tears and trimmed to the ora serrata.  After all the vitreous had been removed and the membranes released, the retina was completely mobilized.  Total fluid-air exchange was carried out with complete settling of the retina.  Endolaser was applied around the margins of the retinal tears, and altogether several 100 applications were placed in the periphery.  Good reaction was achieved.  The eye was inspected with an indirect ophthalmoscope.  The retina was noted to be completely attached.  The instruments were removed from the eye.  The sclerotomy sites were closed with #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The infusion line was removed from the eye and tied with a #7-0 Vicryl suture.  The conjunctivae and Tenon's were closed with #6-0 plain gut suture.  A collagen shield soaked with Tobrex placed over the surface of the globe, and a pressure bandage was put in place.  The patient left the operating room in a good condition."

He had multiple levels of disease, but clinically, it was C6 radiculopathy.  We tested him in the office and he had weakness referable to that nerve.  The procedure was done at that level.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room at which time an intravenous line was placed.  General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained.  He was positioned supine in the operative area and the right neck was prepared.,An incision was made and carried down to the ventral spine on the right in the usual manner.  An x-ray confirmed our location.,We were impressed by the degenerative change and the osteophyte overgrowth.,As we had excepted, the back of the disk space was largely closed off by osteophytes.  We patiently drilled through them to the posterior ligament.  We went through that until we saw the dura.,We carefully went to the patient's symptomatic, left side.  The C6 foramen was narrowed by uncovertebral joint overgrowth.  The foramen was open widely.,An allograft was placed.  An anterior Steffee plate was placed.  Closure was commenced.,The wound was closed in layers with Steri-Strips on the skin.  A dressing was applied.,It should be noted that the above operation was done also with microscopic magnification and illumination."
 Ophthalmology, Blepharoplasty ,"BLEPHAROPLASTY,The patient was prepped and draped.  The upper lid skin was marked out in a lazy S fashion, and the redundant skin marked out with a Green forceps.  Then the upper lids were injected with 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine and 1 mL of Wydase per 20 mL of solution.,The upper lid skin was then excised within the markings.  Gentle pressure was placed on the upper eyelids, and the fat in each of the compartments was teased out using a scissor and cotton applicator; and then the fat was cross clamped, cut, and the clamp cauterized.  This was done in the all compartments of the middle and medial compartments of the upper eyelid, and then the skin sutured with interrupted 6-0 nylon sutures.  The first suture was placed in the lower eyelid skin picking up the periorbital muscle and then the upper portion of the tarsus and then the upper lid skin.  This created a significant crisp, supratarsal fold.  The upper lid skin was closed in this fashion, and then attention was turned to the lower lid.,An incision was made under the lash line and slightly onto the lateral canthus.  The #15 blade was used to delineate the plane in the lateral portion of the incision, and then using a scissor the skin was cut at the marking.  Then the skin muscle flap was elevated with sharp dissection.  The fat was located and using a scissor the three eyelid compartments were opened.  Fat was teased out, cross clamped, the fat removed, and then the clamp cauterized.  Once this was done the skin was tailored to the lower lid incision site with mouth open and eyes in upward gaze, and then the excess skin removed.  The suture line was sutured with interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  Once this was done the procedure was finished.,The patient left the OR in satisfactory condition.  The patient was given 50 mg of Demerol IM with 25 mg of Phenergan."
 Hematology - Oncology, Mesothelioma - Port-A-Cath Insertion ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mesothelioma.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Mesothelioma.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , Placement of Port-A-Cath, left subclavian vein with fluoroscopy.,ASSISTANT:,  None.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman who underwent right thoracoscopy and was found to have biopsy-proven mesothelioma.  He was brought to the operating room now for Port-A-Cath placement for chemotherapy.  After informed consent was obtained with the patient, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, routine prep and drape of the left chest, left subclavian vein was cannulated with #18 gauze needle, and guidewire was inserted.  Needle was removed.  Small incision was made large enough to harbor the port.  Dilator and introducers were then placed over the guidewire.  Guidewire and dilator were removed, and a Port-A-Cath was introduced in the subclavian vein through the introducers.  Introducers were peeled away without difficulty.  He measured with fluoroscopy and cut to the appropriate length.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  It was then connected to the hub of the port.  Port was then aspirated for patency and flushed with heparinized saline and summoned to the chest wall.  Wounds were then closed.  Needle count, sponge count, and instrument counts were all correct."
 ENT - Otolaryngology, Tracheostomy & Thyroid Isthmusectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Multiple strokes.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure.,2.  Multiple strokes.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Tracheostomy.,2.  Thyroid isthmusectomy.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube.,BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal, less than 25 cc.,INDICATIONS:,  The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the Emergency Department who had had multiple massive strokes.  He had required ventilator assistance and was transported to the ICU setting.  Because of the numerous deficits from the stroke, he is expected to have a prolonged ventilatory course and he will be requiring long-term care.,PROCEDURE: , After all risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with multiple family members in detail, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the Operative Suite where he was placed in supine position and general anesthesia was delivered through the existing endotracheal tube.  The neck was then palpated and marked appropriately in the cricoid cartilage sternal notch and thyroid cartilage marked appropriately with felt-tip marker.  The skin was then anesthetized with a mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine solution.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual fashion.  The surgeons were gowned and gloved.  A vertical skin incision was then made with a #15 blade scalpel extending from approximately two fingerbreadths above the level of the sternum approximately 1 cm above the cricoid cartilage.  Blunt dissection was then carried down until the fascia overlying the strap muscles were identified.  At this point, the midline raphe was identified and the strap muscles were separated utilizing the Bovie cautery.  Once the strap muscles have been identified, palpation was performed to identify any arterial aberration.  A high-riding innominate was not identified.  At this point, it was recognized that the thyroid gland was overlying the trachea could not be mobilized.  Therefore, dissection was carried down through to the cricoid cartilage at which point hemostat was advanced underneath the thyroid gland, which was then doubly clamped and ligated with Bovie cautery.  Suture ligation with #3-0 Vicryl was then performed on the thyroid gland in a double interlocking fashion.  This cleared a significant portion of the trachea.  The overlying pretracheal fascia was then cleared with use of pressured forceps as well as Bovie cautery.  Now, a tracheal hook was placed underneath the cricoid cartilage in order to stabilize the trachea.  The second tracheal ring was identified.  The Bovie cautery reduced to create a tracheal window beneath the second tracheal ring that was inferiorly based.  At this point, the anesthetist was appropriately alerted to deflate the endotracheal tube cuff.  The airway was entered and inferior to the base, window was created.  The anesthetist then withdrew the endotracheal tube until the tip of the tube was identified.  At this point, a #8 Shiley tracheostomy tube was inserted freely into the tracheal lumen.  The balloon was inflated and the ventilator was attached.  He was immediately noted to have return of the CO2 waveform and was ventilating appropriately according to the anesthetist.  Now, all surgical retractors were removed.  The baseplate of the tracheostomy tube was sutured to the patient's skin with #2-0 nylon suture.  The tube was further secured around the patient's neck with IV tubing.  Finally, a drain sponge was placed.  At this point, procedure was felt to be complete.  The patient was returned to the ICU setting in stable condition where a chest x-ray is pending."
 Neurosurgery, Shunt Revision - 1 ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Shunt malfunction.  The patient with a ventriculoatrial shunt.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Shunt malfunction.  The patient with a ventriculoatrial shunt.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal tube anesthesia.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: , Headaches, fluid accumulating along shunt tract.,FINDINGS: , Partial proximal shunt obstruction.,TITLE OF OPERATION:,  Endoscopic proximal shunt revision.,SPECIMENS: , None.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,DEVICES: , Portnoy ventricular catheter.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:,  After satisfactory general endotracheal tube anesthesia was administered, the patient positioned on the operating table in supine position with the right frontal area shaved and the head was prepped and draped in a routine manner.  The old right frontal scalp incision was reopened in a curvilinear manner, and the Bactiseal ventricular catheter was identified as it went into the right frontal horn.  The distal end of the VA shunt was flushed and tested with heparinized saline, found to be patent, and it was then clamped.  Endoscopically, the proximal end was explored and we found debris within the lumen, and then we were able to freely move the catheter around.  We could see along the tract that the tip of the catheter had gone into the surrounding tissue and appeared to have prongs or extensions in the tract, which were going into the catheter consistent with partial proximal obstruction.  A Portnoy ventricular catheter was endoscopically introduced and then the endoscope was bend so that the catheter tip did not go into the same location where it was before, but would take a gentle curve going into the right lateral ventricle.  It flushed in quite well, was left at about 6.5 cm to 7 cm and connected to the existing straight connector and secured with 2-0 Ethibond sutures.  The wounds were irrigated out with Bacitracin and closed in a routine manner using two 3-0 Vicryl for the galea and a 4-0 running Monocryl for the scalp followed by Mastisol and Steri-Strips.  The patient was awakened and extubated having tolerated the procedure well without complications.  It should be noted that the when we were irrigating through the ventricular catheter, fluid easily came out around the catheter indicating that the patient had partial proximal obstruction so that we could probably flow around the old shunt tract and perhaps this was leading to some of the symptomatology or findings of fluid along the chest."
 Ophthalmology, Bilateral Upper Lid Blepharoplasty ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral upper eyelid dermatochalasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Same.,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral upper lid blepharoplasty, (CPT 15822).,ANESTHESIA: , Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , This 65-year-old female demonstrates conditions described above of excess and redundant eyelid skin with puffiness and has requested surgical correction.  The procedure, alternatives, risks and limitations in this individual case have been very carefully discussed with the patient.  All questions have been thoroughly answered, and the patient understands the surgery indicated.  She has requested this corrective repair be undertaken, and a consent was signed.,The patient was brought into the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table.  An intravenous line was started, and sedation and sedation anesthesia was administered IV after preoperative p.o. sedation.  The patient was monitored for cardiac rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation continuously.  The excess and redundant skin of the upper lids producing redundancy and impairment of lateral vision was carefully measured, and the incisions were marked for fusiform excision with a marking pen.  The surgical calipers were used to measure the supratarsal incisions so that the incision was symmetrical from the ciliary margin bilaterally.,The upper eyelid areas were bilaterally injected with 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 Epinephrine for anesthesia and vasoconstriction.  The plane of injection was superficial and external to the orbital septum of the upper and lower eyelids bilaterally.,The face was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.,After waiting a period of approximately ten minutes for adequate vasoconstriction, the previously outlined excessive skin of the right upper eyelid was excised with blunt dissection.  Hemostasis was obtained with a bipolar cautery.  A thin strip of orbicularis oculi muscle was excised in order to expose the orbital septum on the right.  The defect in the orbital septum was identified, and herniated orbital fat was exposed.  The abnormally protruding positions in the medial pocket were carefully excised and the stalk meticulously cauterized with the bipolar cautery unit.  A similar procedure was performed exposing herniated portion of the nasal pocket.  Great care was taken to obtain perfect hemostasis with this maneuver.  A similar procedure of removing skin and taking care of the herniated fat was performed on the left upper eyelid in the same fashion.  Careful hemostasis had been obtained on the upper lid areas.  The lateral aspects of the upper eyelid incisions were closed with a couple of interrupted 7-0 blue Prolene sutures.,At the end of the operation the patient's vision and extraocular muscle movements were checked and found to be intact.  There was no diplopia, no ptosis, no ectropion.  Wounds were reexamined for hemostasis, and no hematomas were noted.  Cooled saline compresses were placed over the upper and lower eyelid regions bilaterally.,The procedures were completed without complication and tolerated well.  The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition.  A follow-up appointment was scheduled, routine post-op medications prescribed, and post-op instructions given to the responsible party.,The patient was released to return home in satisfactory condition."
 Orthopedic, Laminectomy & Foraminotomy & Cervical Fusion ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5.,2.  Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm.,3.  Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5.,2.  Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm.,3.  Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURES,1.  Decompressive left lumbar laminectomy C4-C5 and C5-C6 with neural foraminotomy.,2.  Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5.,3.  Songer wire.,4.  Right iliac bone graft.,TECHNIQUE:  ,The patient was brought to the operating room.  Preoperative evaluations included previous cervical spine surgery.  The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse.  Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6.  There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7.  The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid.  X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid.,The patient had been on pain medication.  The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments.  He was given the option of surgical intervention.  We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression.  I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery.  If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion.  The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking.  I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft.  I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life.  Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely.,The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire.  The wire would be left permanently.,Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve.  His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist.  He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure.  Other procedures may be necessary later.  There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function.  He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life.  He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes.  He could get difficulty swallowing or eating.  He could have substantial weakness in the arm.  He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting.,He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery.,He stated he understood all the risks.  He did not wish to get any other treatments.  He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia.,I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls.  His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder.  The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes.  The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped.  Care was taken to position both arms and both legs.  Pulses were checked.,A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine.  A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure.  Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4.  A lateral view was done after an instrument in place.  This revealed the C6-C7 level.  I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5.  I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level.,I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor.,Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5.  I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left.  I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4.  This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots.  There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used.  Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal.  There was no retraction.  I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found.,At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent.  The nerve roots had been fully decompressed.,I then checked stability.  There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level.  I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion.,I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5.  I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4.  Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5.  I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage.  I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5.,Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped.  An incision made over the iliac crest.  Bleeding vessels were cauterized.  I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest.  I removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone.,I placed the Songer wire through the base of the spinous process of C4 and C5.  Drill holes made with a clip.  I then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process.  I then tightened the Songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire.,Prior to tightening the wire, I also packed cancellous bone with facet at C4-C5.  I then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of C4 and C5.,The hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and Kantrex.  Deep structures were closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed.,No drain was placed in the hip.,A drain was left in the posterior cervical spine.  The deep tissues were closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition."
 Obstetrics / Gynecology, Laparoscopy & Salpingo-oophorectomy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left adnexal mass.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left ovarian lesion.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Laparoscopy with left salpingo-oophorectomy.,ANESTHESIA:,  General.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 50 cc.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,FINDINGS:,  The labia and perineum were within normal limits.  The hymen was found to be intact.  Laparoscopic findings revealed a 4 cm left adnexal mass, which appeared fluid filled.  There were a few calcifications on the surface of the mass.  The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal.  There was no evidence of endometriosis.  The uterus appeared normal in size.  There were no pelvic adhesions noted.,INDICATIONS: , The patient is a 55-year-old gravida 0, para 0 Caucasian female who presents with a left adnexal mass on ultrasound which is 5.3 cm.  She does complain of minimal discomfort.  Bimanual exam was not able to be performed secondary to the vaginal stenosis and completely intact hymen.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken back to the Operative Suite, prepped and draped, and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A 1 cm skin incision was made in the infraumbilical vault.  While tenting up the abdominal wall, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty and the abdomen was insufflated.  This was done using appropriate flow and volume of CO2.  The #11 step trocar was then placed without difficulty.  The above findings were confirmed.  A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.  Steri-Strips were placed on each of the incisions.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle count were x2.  She will go home on Vicodin for pain and followup postoperatively in the office where we will review path report with her."

Hiatal hernia.,3.  Enterogastritis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  ,Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, photography, and biopsy.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The patient has a history of epigastric abdominal pain, persistent in nature.  She has a history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, takes Pepcid frequently.  She has had a history of hiatal hernia.  She is being evaluated at this time for disease process.  She does not have much response from Protonix.,Upon endoscopy, the gastroesophageal junction is approximately 40 cm.  There appeared to be some inflammation at the gastroesophageal junction and a small 1 cm to 2 cm hiatal hernia.  There is no advancement of the gastric mucosa up into the lower one-third of the esophagus.  However there appeared to be inflammation as stated previously in the gastroesophageal junction.  There was some mild inflammation at the antrum of the stomach.  The fundus of the stomach was within normal limits.  The cardia showed some laxity to the lower esophageal sphincter.  The pylorus is concentric.  The duodenal bulb and sweep are within normal limits.  No ulcers or erosions.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient is taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position.  The patient was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed.  Olympus videoscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and upon deglutition passed into the esophagus.  Using air insufflation, panendoscope was advanced down the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and sweep and the above gross findings were noted.  Panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel.  Photographs were taken with the pathology present.  Biopsy was obtained of the antrum of the stomach and also CLO test.  The biopsy is also obtained of the gastroesophageal junction at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o' clock positions to rule out occult Barrett's esophagitis.  Air was aspirated from the stomach and the panendoscope was removed.  The patient sent to recovery room in stable condition."

 Neurology, Rotator Cuff Tear ,"REASON FOR VISIT: , Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy.  I had last seen her on 06/21/07.,At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy.  She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07.  At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI.  I did not have any recent images.  I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today.,She states that her symptoms are unchanged.  She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y.,She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist.  She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note.  No significant right upper extremity symptoms.  No bowel, bladder dysfunction.  No difficulty with ambulation.,FINDINGS: , On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.  Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact.  Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus.  Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally.  Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities.  Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder.,An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity.,Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed.  It is relatively limited study due to artifact.  He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change.  There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis.,I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery.  With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with.  I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections.  The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery.,I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine.,I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks."

 Neurology, Pseudotumor Cerebri ,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,The patient is a 38-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema who comes in because of new onset of headaches.  She comes to clinic by herself.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Dr. X has cared for her since 2002.  She has a Codman-Hakim shunt set at 90 mmH2O.  She last saw us in clinic in January 2008 and at that time we recommended that she followup with Dr. Y for medical management of her chronic headaches.  We also recommended that the patient see a psychiatrist regarding her depression, which she stated that she would followup with that herself.  Today, the patient returns to clinic because of acute onset of headaches that she has had since her shunt was adjusted after an MRI on 04/18/08.  She states that since that time her headaches have been bad.  They woke her up at night.  She has not been able to sleep.  She has not had a good sleep cycle since that time.  She states that the pain is constant and is worse with coughing, straining, and sneezing as well as on standing up.  She states that they feel a little bit better when lying down.  Medication shave not helped her.  She has tried taking Imitrex as well as Motrin 800 mg twice a day, but she states it has not provided much relief.  The pain is generalized, but also noted to be quite intense in the frontal region of her head.  She also reports ringing in the ears and states that she just does not feel well.  She reports no nausea at this time.  She also states that she has been experiencing intermittent blurry vision and dimming lights as well.  She tells me that she has an appointment with Dr. Y tomorrow.  She reports no other complaints at this time.,MAJOR FINDINGS:,  On examination today, this is a pleasant 38-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area without difficulty.  She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt.,Vital Signs:  Blood pressure 153/86, pulse 63, and respiratory rate 16.,Cranial Nerves:  Intact for extraocular movements.  Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movements are all intact.  I did not know any papilledema on exam bilaterally.,I examined her shut site, which is clean, dry, and intact.  She did have a small 3 mm to 4 mm round scab, which was noted farther down from her shunt reservoir.  It looks like there is a little bit of dry blood there.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient appears to have had worsening headaches since shunt adjustment back after an MRI.,PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:,1.  Pseudotumor cerebri without papilledema.,2.  Migraine headaches.,PROCEDURES:,  I programmed her shunt to 90 mmH2O.,PLAN:,  It was noted that the patient began to have an acute onset of headache pain after her shunt adjustment approximately a week and a half ago.  I had programmed her shunt back to 90 mmH2O at that time and confirmed it with an x-ray.  However, the picture of the x-ray was not the most desirable picture.  Thus, I decided to reprogram the shunt back to 90 mmH2O today and have the patient return to Sinai for a skull x-ray to confirm the setting at 90.  In addition, she told me that she is scheduled to see Dr. Y tomorrow, so she should followup with him and also plan on contacting the Wilmer Eye Institute to setup an appointment.  She should followup with the Wilmer Eye Institute as she is complaining of blurry vision and dimming of the lights occasionally.,Total visit time was approximately 60 minutes and about 10 minutes of that time was spent in counseling the patient."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Aortogram - Leg claudication. ,"PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:,  Left leg claudication.,POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: ,  Left leg claudication.,OPERATION PERFORMED: , Aortogram with bilateral, segmental lower extremity run off.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  ,The patient presents with lower extremity claudication.  She is a 68-year-old woman, who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures.  Risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding, infection, arterial trauma requiring surgery, access issues and recurrence.  She appears to understand and agrees to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the Angio Suite, placed in a supine position.  After adequate conscious sedation, both groins were prepped with Chloraseptic prep.  Cloth towels and paper drapes were placed.  Local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance, the common femoral artery was accessed.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a ,4-French sheath.  Through the 4-French sheath a 4-French Omni flush catheter was placed.  The glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery.  Using power injector an aortogram proceeded.,The catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation.  A timed run-off view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed run-off in the left, I opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach.  The catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire, I obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.  The Omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire rather exchanged for an Amplatz stiff wire.  This was left in place and the 4-French sheath removed and replaced with a 6-French destination 45-cm sheath.  This was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed.  I identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty.,The patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate.  A glidewire was carefully advanced using Roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels.  A 4-mm x 4-cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question.,Final views after dilatation revealed a dissection.  A search for a 5-mm stent was performed, but none of this was available.  For this reason, I used a 6-mm x 80-mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery.  Post dilatation was performed with a 4-mm angioplasty balloon.  Further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery.  No significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan.  For this reason, I chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg.,I then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6-French Angio-Seal device.  Attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered.  Access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.  Guidewire was threaded followed by a 4-French sheath.  This was immediately exchanged for the 6-French destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery.  The glidewire was exchanged for the Amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath.  The destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained.  Initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal.,Views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery.  For this reason, I performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4-mm balloon.  A minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation.  No further significant abnormality was identified.  To avoid placing a stent in the small vessel I left it alone and approached the popliteal artery.  A 3-mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79% popliteal artery stenosis.  Reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4-mm balloon could have been used.  However, due to her propensity for dissection I opted not to.  I then exchanged the glidewire for an O1 for Thruway guidewire using an exchange length.  This was placed into the left posterior tibial artery.  A 2-mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery.  I then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel.  Final images showed improved run-off to the right calf.  The destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an Angio-Seal deployed.,FINDINGS: , Aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma.  No evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally.  There is a single left renal artery.  The infrarenal aorta, both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal.  On the right, a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally.  At the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted.  Moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel run-off through the posterior tibial artery is noted.  The perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf.  The dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level.,On the left, the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent.  Again, at the distal third of the thigh, there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery.  This was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement.  The popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice.,IMPRESSION,1.  Normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery.,2.  Normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries.,3.  The proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.  Successful angioplasty with reasonable results in the distal superficial femoral, popliteal and proximal posterior tibial artery as described.,4.  Normal proximal left superficial femoral artery with functional occlusion of the distal left superficial femoral artery successfully treated with angioplasty and stent placement.  Run-off to the left lower extremity is via a patent perineal and posterior tibial artery."
 Nephrology, Pyeloplasty - Robotic ,"PROCEDURES:,1.  Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty.,2.  Anterograde right ureteral stent placement.,3.  Transposition of anterior crossing vessels on the right.,4.  Nephrolithotomy.,DIAGNOSIS:,  Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction.,DRAINS:,1.  Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank.,2.  Foley catheter times one.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Less than 30 cc.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS:,1.  Renal pelvis.,2.  Kidney stones.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries.  Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery."
 ENT - Otolaryngology, Consult - Enlarged Tonsils ,"HISTORY: , The patient is a 15-year-old female who was seen in consultation at the request of Dr. X on 05/15/2008 regarding enlarged tonsils.  The patient has been having difficult time with having two to three bouts of tonsillitis this year.  She does average about four bouts of tonsillitis per year for the past several years.  She notes that throat pain and fever with the actual infections.  She is having no difficulty with swallowing.  She does have loud snoring, though there have been no witnessed observed sleep apnea episodes.  She is a mouth breather at nighttime, however.  The patient does feel that she has a cold at today's visit.  She has had tonsil problems again for many years.  She does note a history of intermittent hoarseness as well.  This is particularly prominent with the current cold that she has had.  She had been seen by Dr. Y in Muskegon who had also recommended a tonsillectomy, but she reports she would like to get the surgery done here in the Ludington area as this is much closer to home.  For the two tonsillitis, she is on antibiotics again on an average about four times per year.  They do seem to help with the infections, but they tend to continue to recur.  The patient presents today for further workup, evaluation, and treatment of the above-listed symptoms.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,ALLERGY/IMMUNOLOGIC:  Negative.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Negative.,PULMONARY:  Negative.,GASTROINTESTINAL:  Negative.,GENITOURINARY:  Negative.,NEUROLOGIC:  Negative.,VISUAL:  Negative.,DERMATOLOGIC:  Negative.,ENDOCRINE:  Negative.,MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Negative.,CONSTITUTIONAL:  Negative.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , Pertinent for previous cholecystectomy.,FAMILY HISTORY:,  No family history of bleeding disorder.

Pathologic insufficiency.,2.  Fracture of the T8 vertebra and T9 vertebra.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.  Fracture reduction with insertion of prosthetic device at T8 with kyphoplasty.,2.  Vertebroplasties at T7 and T9 with insertion of prosthetic device.,ANESTHESIA: , Local with sedation.,SPECIMEN: , Bone from the T8 vertebra.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,SURGICAL INDICATIONS:,  The patient is an 80-year-old female who had previous history of compression fractures.  She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae.  She was in extreme pain.  This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities.  She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives.  The patient provided informed consent.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table.  She was given sedative.  The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae.  Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed.,Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side.  This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left.  Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well.  Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally.  Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously.  Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion.  Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae.  The Jamshidi needles were then removed.  A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae.  This bone was then removed and sent to the lab.  The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images.  Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle.  This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion.  Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted.  The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed.  An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7.  In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well.  A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images.  The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body.  Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae.  The balloons were inserted bilaterally.  The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg.  These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture.  Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed.  The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas.  This was done directly under image intensification.  Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra.  The cement was allowed to cure.  The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained.  The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation.  The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion.  Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape.  She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed.  She was moving all four extremities without deficit.  She had no significant pain."

Application of anterior cervical locking plate C3-C5 (CPT 22845).,ANESTHESIA:,  General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  ,250 cc.,OPERATIVE INDICATIONS:  ,The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital after a fall, presenting with neck and arm pain as well as weakness.  His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness.  We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options.  Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections.  I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal.  Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break.  We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation.  I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone.  Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications.  He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded.  Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case.  The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides.  A roll was placed between the shoulder blades.  The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion.  Ten pounds of traction was applied.  A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision.  The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle.  This was then split in line with its fibers.  Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized.  A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location.  The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit.  Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains.,Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5.  This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus.  The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes.  Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally.  Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression.  The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen.,A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace.  Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed.  The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field.  After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position.  There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace.  All weight was then removed from the crania tongs.,The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis.  Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5.  There was excellent purchase.  A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts.  The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase.,Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks.  The carotid pulse was strong.  A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware.  The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure.  Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing.  The drain was hooked to bulb suction.  A Philadelphia collar was applied.,The cranial tongs were carefully removed.  The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone.  There was good hemostasis.,The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well."

The patient with continued symptoms of pelvic pain and hypermenorrhea and desired definitive surgical treatment.,FINDINGS AT THE TIME OF SURGERY: , Uterus is anteverted and boggy with a very narrow introitus with a palpable left adnexal mass.,On laparotomy, the uterus was noted to be slightly enlarged with fibroid change as well as a hemorrhagic appearing left adnexal mass.  The bowel, omentum, and appendix had a normal appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operative suite where anesthesia was found to be adequate.  She was then prepared and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made with a scalpel and carried through the underlying layer of fascia with the second scalpel.  The fascia was then incised in the midline.  The fascial incision was then extended laterally with Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was grasped with Kochers with the underlying rectus muscle dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  Attention was then turned to the inferior aspect of this incision, which in a similar fashion was tented up with the underlying rectus muscle and dissected off bluntly and sharply with Mayo scissors.  The rectus muscle was then separated in the midline.  The peritoneum was identified, tented up with hemostats and entered sharply with Metzenbaum scissors.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly and inferiorly with good visualization of the bladder.  The uterus and left adnexa were then palpated and brought out into the surgical field.  The fundus of the uterus was grasped with a Lahey clamp.  The GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  The bladder blade was placed.  The bowel was packed away with moist laparotomy sponges and the extension through GYN/Balfour retractor was placed.  At this time, the patient's anatomy was surveyed and there was found to be a left hemorrhagic appearing adnexal mass.  Attention was first turned to the right round ligament, which was tented up with a Babcock and a small window was made beneath the round ligament with a hemostat.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected with the broad ligament being skeletonized on both sides.  Next, the right ________ was isolated bluntly as the patient had a previous RSO.  This was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  Attention was then turned to the left round ligament, which was tented up with the Babcock.  Small window was made beneath it and the broad ligament with hemostat was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, transected, and skeletonized with the aid of Metzenbaums.  The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then bluntly isolated.  It was then suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture, doubly clamped with Kocher clamps, and transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture with a Heaney stitch.  The bladder flap was then placed on tension with Allis clamps.  It was then dissected off of the lower uterine segment with the aid of Metzenbaum scissors and Russians.  It was then gently pushed off of lower uterine segment with the aid of a moist Ray-Tec.  The uterine arteries were then skeletonized bilaterally.,They were then clamped with straight Kocher clamps, transected, and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The cardinal ligament and uterosacral complexes on both sides were then clamped with curved Kocher clamps.  These were then transected and suture ligated with #0 Vicryl suture.  The lower uterine segment was then grasped with Lahey clamps, at which time the cervix was already visible.  It was then entered with the last transection.  The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum and the uterus, cervix, and left adnexa were amputated off the vagina with the aid of Jorgenson scissors.  The angles of the vaginal cuff were then grasped with Kocher clamps.  A Betadine-soaked Ray-Tec was then pushed into the vagina and the vaginal cuff was closed with #0 Vicryl suture in a running lock fashion with care taken to transect the ipsilateral cardinal ligament, at which time the suction tip was changed and copious suction irrigation was performed.  Good hemostasis was appreciated.  A figure-of-eight suture in the center of the vaginal cuff was placed with #0 Vicryl.  This was tagged for later use.  The uterosacrals on both sides were incorporated into the vaginal cuff with the aid of #0 Vicryl suture.  The round ligaments were then pulled into the vaginal cuff using the figure-of-eight suture placed in the center of the vaginal cuff and these were tied in place.  The pelvis was then again copiously suctioned irrigated and hemostasis was appreciated.  The peritoneal surfaces were then reapproximated with the aid of #3-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The GYN/Balfour retractor and bladder blade were then removed.  The bowel was then packed.  Again copious suction irrigation was performed with hemostasis appreciated.  The peritoneum was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The fascia was then reapproximated with #0 Vicryl suture in a running fashion.  The Scarpa's  fascia was then reapproximated with #3-0 plain gut in a running fashion and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Steri-Strips were placed.  At the end of the procedure, the sponge that was pushed into the vagina previously was removed and hemostasis was appreciated vaginally.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to Recovery in stable condition.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.  Specimens include uterus, cervix, left fallopian tube, and ovary."
 Neurology, SOAP - Temporal Mass ,"SUBJECTIVE: , The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass.  Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma.  ,OBJECTIVE: , The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15.  Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact.  Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities.  Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception.  Cerebellar exam is intact.  Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes.  Speech is appropriate.  Judgment is intact.

 Orthopedic, Arthroplasty - Hammertoe ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Arthroplasty of the right second digit.,The patient is a 77-year-old Hispanic male who presents to ABCD Hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe.  The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe.  The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart.  H&P is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position.  Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time.  Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table.  After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner.  The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg.  The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed.  A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx.,Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup.  Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue.  Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin.  This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection.  Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified.  Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint.  The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure.  Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup.  It was elevated with fresh #15 blade.  The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally.  Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner.  The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head.,Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues.  Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected.  Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon.  The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology.  The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment.  The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment.  Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity.  Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue.  Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.  The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site.  Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin.  The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot.,The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe.  Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes.  While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot.  The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain.  The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation.  The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care.  The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications."
 Pediatrics - Neonatal, H&P - Infant with fever ,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:, Irritable baby with fever for approximately 24 hours.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:, This 6-week-old infant was doing well until about 48 hours prior to admission, developed irritability, fussiness, a little bit of vomiting, and then fever up to 103-degrees. The child was brought into the emergency room and a complete septic workup was done, and the child is being treated in a rule out sepsis protocol.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:, This child was born by term pregnancy, spontaneous vaginal delivery, to a mother who was a teenager. He is bottle fed and he has had his hepatitis B vaccine. He lives in a home where there are smokers. This is his first illness.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:, He has had no previous surgeries.,MEDICATION (S):, He takes no medications on a regular basis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Positive for those things mentioned already in the past medical history and history of present illness.,FAMILY HISTORY:, The family history is noncontributory.,SOCIAL HISTORY:, This child lives with his mother and father, both are teenagers, unmarried, who are not well educated. Grandmother is a heavy smoker.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS: The vital signs are stable, the patient is febrile at 101-degrees.,HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT/GENERAL: The anterior fontanelle is not bulging. The rest of the examination is within normal limits. The neck is supple, no nuchal rigidity noted, though this child is irritable and fussy, and whines and cries where ever you make touch him. He has an irritable disposition no matter what you do to him, and whines even while at rest.,HEART: The heart rate is rapid, but there was no murmur noted.,LUNGS: The lungs are clear.,ABDOMEN: The abdomen is without mass, distention, or visceromegaly.,GENITOURINARY/RECTAL: Examination within normal limits.,EXTREMITIES: The extremities are normal. No Kernig's or Brudzinski sign.,NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, no focal deficits. As I mentioned before, the child is extremely irritable, fussy, and has a great deal of general inconsolability.,SKIN: The child, in addition, has a skin pattern of cutis marmorata, which I think is a bit more exaggerated since the child is febrile and has some peripheral vasodilatation.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION (S):, Likely viral syndrome, viral meningitis, flu syndrome.,PLAN:, Continue the septic workup protocol, supportive care with IV fluids, and Tylenol as needed for fever, and continue the antibiotics until spinal fluid cultures and blood cultures are negative for 48 hours. In addition, I believe that the rapid heart rate is a sinus tachycardia, and is related to the child's illness, irritability, and his fever. In addition, there were no intracranial bruits noted."
 Pediatrics - Neonatal, Pediatric Urology Letter ,"XYZ, M.D. ,Suite 123, ABC Avenue ,City, STATE 12345 ,RE:  XXXX, XXXX ,MR#:  0000000,Dear Dr. XYZ: ,XXXX was seen in followup in the Pediatric Urology Clinic.  I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. ,Sincerely yours,"

 Orthopedic, I&D & Open Reduction - Forearm ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Grade 1 compound fracture, right mid-shaft radius and ulna with complete displacement and shortening.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Grade 1 compound fracture, right mid-shaft radius and ulna with complete displacement and shortening.,OPERATIONS:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of skin subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and bone, right forearm.,2.  Open reduction, right both bone forearm fracture with placement of long-arm cast.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,TOURNIQUET: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  25 mL.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATIONS:  ,The patient suffered injury at which time he fell over a concrete bench.  He landed mostly on the right arm.  He noted some bleeding at the time of the injury and a small puncture wound.  He was taken to the emergency room and diagnosed a compound both bone forearm fracture, and based on this, he was seen for malalignment.,He was indicated the above-noted procedure.  This procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure was discussed at length with the patient's parents and they understood them well.  Risks and benefits were also discussed.  Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain on full range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for repeat debridement, risk of need for internal fixation, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed.  They understood these well.  All questions were answered and they signed the consent for procedure as described.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved.  The right forearm was inspected.  There was noted to be a 3-mm puncture-type wound over the volar aspect of the forearm in the middle one-third overlying the radial one-half.  There was bleeding in this region.  No gross contamination was seen.  At this point, under fluoroscopic control, I did attempt to see a fracture.  I was unable to do the forearm under the close reduction techniques.  At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  An incision was made through the puncture wound site extending this proximally and distally.  There was noted to be some slight amount of nonviable tissue at the skin edge and debridement was required and performed.  I also did perform a light debridement of the nonviable subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and small bony fragments were also removed.  These were all completely debrided appropriately and then at this point, a thorough irrigation was performed of the radius, which I communicated through the puncture wound.  Both ends were clearly visualized, and thorough irrigation was performed using total of 6 L of antibiotic solution.  All nonviable gross contaminated tissue was removed.  At this point with the bones in direct visualization, I did reduce the bony ends to anatomic alignment with excellent bony approximation.  Proper alignment of tissue and angulation was confirmed.,At this point, under fluoroscopic control confirmed the radius and ulna in anatomic position, which will be completely displaced and shortened previously.  The ulna was now also noted to be in anatomic alignment.,At this point, the region was thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis confirmed and closure then begun.  The skin was reapproximated using 3-0 nylon suture.  The visual puncture wound region was left open and this was intact with the depth of the wound down the bone using 1.5-inch Nugauze with iodoform.  Sterile dressing applied and a long-arm cast with the forearm in neutral position was applied.  X-ray with fluoroscopic evaluation was performed, which confirmed.  They maintained excellent bony approximation and the anatomic alignment.  The long-arm cast was then completely mature.  No complications were encountered throughout the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was then taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
 Cardiovascular / Pulmonary, Bronchoscopy ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Atelectasis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Mucous plugging.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED: , Bronchoscopy.,ANESTHESIA: , Lidocaine topical 2%, Versed 3 mg IV.  Conscious sedation.,PROCEDURE: , At bedside, a bronchoscope was passed down the tracheostomy tube under monitoring.  The main carina was visualized.  The trachea was free of any secretions.  The right upper lobe, middle and lower lobes appeared to have some mucoid secretions but minimal and with some erythema.  Left mainstem appeared patent.  Left lower lobe had slight plugging in the left base, but much better that previous bronchoscopy findings.  The area was lavaged with some saline and cleared.  The patient tolerated the procedure well."
 Gastroenterology, Gastroscopy - 3 ,"PROCEDURE: , Gastroscopy.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Barrett esophagus.,MEDICATIONS: , MAC.,PROCEDURE: , The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the transverse duodenum.  The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.  He tolerated the procedure well.,FINAL DIAGNOSES:,1.  A short-segment Barrett esophagus.,2.  Hiatal hernia.,3.  Incidental fundic gland polyps in the gastric body.,4.  Otherwise, normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,1.  Follow up biopsy report.,2.  Continue PPI therapy.,3.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.,4.  Surveillance endoscopy for Barrett in 3 years (if pathology confirms this diagnosis)."

There were two minutes remaining in the six-minute walk test.  The patient does have tight hamstrings as well as a negative slump test.,ASSESSMENT: , The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy intervention in order to address the following problem list.,PROBLEM LIST:,1.  Increased pain.,2.  Decreased ability to complete tasks and hobbies.,3"
 Orthopedic, Ligament Reconstruction & Tendon Interposition Arthroplasty ,"OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.,Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field.  Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium.  An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint.  Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon.  The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid.  The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit.  Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision.  The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures.  Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound.,The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal.  A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration.  The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position.  The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor.  Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect.  The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures.,Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire.  The pin was cut at the level of the skin.,All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch.,Sterile dressings were then applied.  The tourniquet was deflated.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."

Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.  She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility.  She can resume her medications per med rec sheets.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: , As previously mentioned.,FOLLOWUP:,  We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks.  She needs to call for any shortness of breath, temperature greater than 101.5, chest pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, any redness, swelling or foul smelling drainage from her wounds."
 Orthopedic, MRI L-Spine - Subarachnoid Seeding ,"CC:, Progressive lower extremity weakness.,HX: ,This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy.,On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate.

Though there was enough of a suspicion of ""drop"" metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained.,COURSE:, The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R > L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice."
 Ophthalmology, Ahmed Shunt Placement ,"PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,While in the holding area, the patient received a peripheral IV from the nursing staff.  In addition, pilocarpine 1% was placed into the operative eye, two times, separated by 10 minutes.  The patient was wheeled to the operating suite where the anesthesia team established peripheral monitoring lines.  Through the IV, the patient received IV sedation in the form of propofol and once somnolent from this, a retrobulbar block was administrated consisting of 2% Xylocaine plain.  Approximately 3 mL were administered.  The patient then underwent a Betadine prep with respect to the face, lens, lashes, and eye.  During the draping process, care was taken to isolate the lashes.  A Vicryl traction suture was placed through the superior cornea and the eye was reflected downward to expose the superior temporal conjunctiva.  Approximately 8 to 10 mm posterior to limbus, the conjunctiva was incised and dissected forward to the limbus.  Blunt dissection was carried out in the superotemporal quadrant.  Next, a 2 x 3-mm scleral flap was outlined that was one-half scleral depth in thickness.  This flap was cut forward to clear cornea using a crescent blade.  The Ahmed shunt was then primed and placed in the superior temporal quadrant and it was sutured in place with two 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The tube was then cut to an appropriate length to enter the anterior chamber.  The anterior chamber was then entered after a paracentesis wound had been made temporally.  A trabeculectomy was done and then the tube was threaded through the trabeculectomy site.  The tube was sutured in place with a multi-wrapped 8-0 nylon suture.  The scleral flap was then sutured in place with two 10-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed, rotated and buried.  A scleral patch was then placed of an appropriate size over the two.  It was sutured in place with interrupted 8-0 nylon sutures.  The knots were trimmed.  The overlying conjunctiva was then closed with a running 8-0 Vicryl suture with a BV needle.  The anterior chamber was filled with Viscoat to keep it deep as the eye was somewhat soft.  A good flow was established with irrigation into the anterior chamber.  Homatropine, Econopred, and Vigamox drops were placed into the eye.  A patch and shield were placed over the eye after removing the draping and the speculum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was taken to the recovery in good condition.  He will be seen in followup in the office tomorrow."

 Nephrology, Nephrectomy - Radical (Laparoscopic) ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Right renal mass.,POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: , Right renal mass.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  100 mL.,X-RAYS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , Right radical nephrectomy specimen.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General endotracheal.,DRAINS:,  16-French Foley catheter per urethra.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 71-year-old woman recently diagnosed with 6.5 cm right upper pole renal mass.  This is an enhancing lesion suspicious for renal cell carcinoma versus oncocytoma.  I discussed a variety of options with her, and she opted to proceed with a laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy.  All questions were answered, and she wished to proceed with surgery as planned.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After acquisition of appropriate written and informed consent and administration of perioperative antibiotics, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table.  Note that, sequential compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and were activated per induction of anesthesia.  After institution of adequate general anesthetic via the endotracheal route, she was placed into the right anterior flank position with the right side elevated in a roll and the right arm across her chest.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and she was securely taped to the table to prevent shifting during the procedure.  Her abdomen was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion after placing a 16-French Foley catheter per urethra to gravity drainage.  The abdomen was insufflated in the right outer quadrant.  Note that, the patient had had previous surgery which complicated accesses somewhat and that she had a previous hysterectomy.  The abdomen was insufflated into the right lateral abdomen with Veress needle to 50 mm of pressure without incident.  We then placed a 10/12 Visiport trocar approximately 7 cm lateral to the umbilicus.  Once this had entered into the peritoneal cavity without incident, the remaining trocars were all placed.  Under direct laparoscopic visualization, we placed three additional trocars; an 11-mm screw-type trocar in the umbilicus, a 6-mm screw-type trocar in the upper midline approximately 7 cm above the umbilicus, and 10/12 trocar in the lower midline about 7 cm below the umbilicus within and over the old hysterectomy scar.  There were some adhesions of omentum to the underside of that scar, and these were taken down sharply using laparoscopic scissors.,We began nephrectomy procedure by reflecting the right colon, by incising the white line of Toldt.  This exposed the retroperitoneum on the right side.  The duodenum was identified and reflected medially in a Kocher maneuver using sharp dissection only.  We then identified the ureter and gonadal vein in the retroperitoneum.  The gonadal vein was left down along the vena cava, and the plane underneath the ureter was elevated and this plane was carried up towards the renal hilum.  Sequential packets of tissue were taken using primarily the LigaSure Atlas device.  Once we got to the renal hilum, it became apparent that this patient had two sets of renal arteries and veins.  We proceeded then and skeletonized the structures into four individual packets.  We then proceeded to perform the upper pole dissection and developing the plane above the kidney and between the kidney and adrenal gland.  The adrenal was spared during this procedure.  There was no contiguous connection between the renal mass and a right adrenal gland.  This plane of dissection was taken down primarily using the LigaSure device.  We then sequentially took the four vessels going to the kidney initially taking two renal arteries with the endo GI stapler and then to renal veins again with endo GI stapler sequential flaring.  Once this was completed, the kidney was free except for its attachment to the ureter and lateral attachments.  The lateral attachments of the kidney were taken down using the LigaSure Atlas device, and then the ureter was doubly clipped and transected.  The kidney was then freed within the retroperitoneum.  A 50-mm EndoCatch bag was introduced through the lower most trocar site, and the kidney was placed into this bag for subsequent extraction.  We extended the lower most trocar site approximately 6 cm to facilitate extraction.  The kidney was removed and passed off the table as a specimen for pathology.  This was bivalved by pathology, and we reviewed the specimen."
 Neurology, Bilateral Carotid Cerebral Angiogram ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Carotid artery occlusive disease.,2.  Peripheral vascular disease.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Carotid artery occlusive disease.,2.  Peripheral vascular disease.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED:,1.  Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram.,2.  Right femoral-popliteal angiogram.,FINDINGS: , The right carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized.  The right internal carotid artery was found to be very tortuous with kinking in its cervical portions, but no focal stenosis was noted.  Likewise, the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the right middle cerebral artery.,The left carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized.  The cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery showed a 30 to 40% stenosis with small ulcer crater present.  The intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the left middle cerebral artery.,Visualization of the right lower extremity showed no significant disease.,PROCEDURE: , With the patient in supine position under local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation, the groin areas were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.,The common femoral artery was punctured in a routine retrograde fashion and a 5-French introducer sheath was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance.  A catheter was then placed in the aortic arch and the right and left common carotid arteries were then selectively catheterized and visualized as described above.,Following completion of the above, the catheter and introducer sheath were removed.  Heparin had been initially given, which was reversed with protamine.  Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes, followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and sandbag compression.,The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout."
